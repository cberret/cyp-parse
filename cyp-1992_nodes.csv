  FROM CROSSBOWS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY:  THWARTING THE STATE VIA
                     TECHNOLOGY
 
  Given at the Future of Freedom Conference, November 1987
 
 
     You   know,   technology--and   particularly   computer
technology--has often gotten a bad rap in  Libertarian  cir-
cles.  We tend to think of Orwell's 1984, or Terry Gilliam's
Brazil,  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin's
slave/citizens on their own side of the border, or  the  so-
phisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those on
his ""enemies list.""  Or, we recognize that for the price  of
a  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of
sound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by
a  government  policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be-
longings if it beeps.
 
     But I think that mind-set is a mistake.   Before  there
were cattle prods, governments tortured their prisoners with
clubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before  there  were lasers for
eavesdropping, governments used binoculars and  lip-readers.
Though  government certainly uses technology to oppress, the
evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.
 
     In fact, technology represents one of the most  promis-
ing  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms from
those who have stolen them.  By its very nature,  it  favors
the  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can-
not).  It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  the
merit  of  the  new(  over  the sluggish (who cling to time-
tested ways).  And what two better words are  there  to  de-
scribe government bureaucracy than ""dull"" and ""sluggish""?
 
     One  of  the  clearest,  classic triumphs of technology
over tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portable
crossbow.   With it, an untrained peasant could now reliably
and lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  if
that  target  were  a mounted, chain-mailed knight.  (Unlike
the longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and  could
get  off  more shots per unit time, the crossbow required no
formal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  required
elaborate  visual,  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to
achieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder  of  a  crossbow
could simply put the weapon to his shoulder, sight along the
arrow  itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar-
get.)
 
     Moreover, since just about  the  only  mounted  knights
likely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government
soldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the  device  was
plain:    With it, the common rabble could defend themselves
not only against one another, but against their governmental
masters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor-
piercing  bullet,  and, consequently, kings and priests (the
medieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and
Crossbows)  threatened  death  and  excommunication, respec-
tively, for its unlawful possession.
 
     Looking at later developments, we  see  how  technology
like  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the
handgun, later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced
machine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal
and inter-group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45
called ""the equalizer.""  A frail dance-hall hostess with one
in  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself
against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise-
ments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the
repeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  ""a  man  on
horseback,  armed with one of these rifles, simply cannot be
captured.""  And, as long as his captors  were  relying  upon
flintlocks  or  single-shot rifles, the quote is doubtless a
true one.
 
     Updating now to  the  present,  the  public-key  cipher
(with  a  personal  computer to run it) represents an equiv-
alent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  can
such  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one's
own possession, but it can also permit two strangers to  ex-
change   information   over   an   insecure   communications
channel--a  wiretapped   phone   line,   for   example,   or
skywriting, for that matter)--without ever having previously
met  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand-dollar com-
puter, you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  CRAY
X-MP  can't  crack in a year.  Within a few years, it should
be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi-
cations; soon after that, full-color digitized video images.
Technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete,  it
will  have  totally demolished government's control over in-
formation transfer.
 
     I'd like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat-
ics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm is
called the RSA algorithm, after Rivest, Shamir, and  Adleman
who  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the fact
that, if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very
large  primes,  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the
two prime factors from analysis  of  their  product.    ""Ex-
tremely""  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100
digits apiece, then their 200-digit product cannot  in  gen-
eral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful
computer now in existence.
 
     The  ""public"" part of the key consists of (1) the prod-
uct  pq  of the two large primes p and q, and (2)  one  fac-
tor,  call it  x  , of the product  xy  where  xy = {(p-1) *
(q-1) + 1}.  The ""private"" part of the key consists  of  the
other factor  y.
 
     Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned
into an integer--either by using ASCII,  or  even  a  simple
A=01,  B=02,  C=03, ... , Z=26 representation.  This integer
is then raised to the power  x (modulo pq) and the resulting
integer is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiver
decrypts by taking this integer to the  (secret)  power    y
(modulo  pq).  It can be shown that this process will always
yield the original number started with.
 
     What makes this a groundbreaking development,  and  why
it  is  called  ""public-key""  cryptography,""  is  that I can
openly publish the product  pq and the number   x   ,  while
keeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send me
an encrypted message, namely
                       x
                     a    (mod pq)  ,
but only I can recover the original message  a  , by  taking
what  they  send, raising it to the power  y  and taking the
result (mod pq).  The risky step (meeting to exchange cipher
keys) has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trust
each other enough to want to meet, may  still  reliably  ex-
change  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected and
disseminated his own  pq  and his  x  ,   while  maintaining
the secrecy of his own  y.
 
     Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a ""dig-
ital signature,"" to enable one to authenticate the source of
a given message.  Normally, if I want to send you a message,
I raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  (mod
your pq)  and send that.
 
    However,  if in my message, I take the plaintext  a and
raise it to my (secret) power  y  , take the result  (mod my
pq), then raise that result to your x   (mod  your  pq)  and
send this, then even after you have normally ""decrypted"" the
message,  it  will still look like garbage.  However, if you
then raise it to my public power x   , and take  the  result
(mod  my public pq  ), so you will not only recover the ori-
ginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but I
could have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secret
y).
 
     And these are the very concerns by the way that are to-
day tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of
personal  computers.    On the one hand, they recognize that
American schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com-
puters  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so, in
fact, because there are things computers can do  which  will
interest  (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds.  And it is pre-
cisely these students who one generation hence will be going
head-to-head against their Soviet  counterparts.    For  the
Soviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to
teach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning
ballistics.    On  the  other hand, whatever else a personal
computer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copying
machine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words  of
text,  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If this
weren't threatening enough, the computer that  performs  the
copy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but
unbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac-
cessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.   (The relatively few
copying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten-
sively than machine guns are in the United States.)
 
     Now  the  ""conservative"" position is that we should not
sell these computers to the Soviets, because they could  use
them  in weapons systems.  The ""liberal"" position is that we
should sell them, in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and
cooperation--and  anyway,  if  we don't make the sale, there
will certainly be some other nation willing to.
 
     For my part, I'm ready to suggest that the  Libertarian
position should be to give them to the Soviets for free, and
if  necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn't
work load up an SR-71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over
Moscow in the middle of the night.  Paid for by private sub-
scription, of course, not taxation . . . I confess that this
is not a position that has gained much support among members
of  the conventional left-right political spectrum, but, af-
ter all, in the words of one of Illuminatus's characters, we
are political non-Euclideans:   The shortest distance  to  a
particular  goal may not look anything like what most people
would consider a ""straight line.""    Taking  a  long  enough
world-view,  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern-
ment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to
the enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution of
the Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen
missiles aimed at Moscow.
 
     But  there's  the rub:  A ""long enough"" world view does
suggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and  the
simply  stupid  will ""get what they deserve,"" but what's not
immediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being
killed, enslaved, or pauperized in the process.
 
    When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at-
tack freedom, they possessed a reasonably  stable,  healthy,
functioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed to
hamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  political
gradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now,  we  have
patchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wire
and spit.  The state not only taxes us to  ""feed  the  poor""
while also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive
up food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub-
sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in-
crease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witness
the fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as
potentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years
ago.  When the price went up,  we  were  told,  the  economy
risked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increase
was called the ""moral equivalent of war"" and the Feds  swung
into  action.    For the first time in American history, the
speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be-
came an issue of Federal concern.   Now, when the  price  of
oil  drops, again we risk problems, this time because Ameri-
can oil companies and Third World  basket-case  nations  who
sell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our
grossly over-extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  that
government  should now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC has
lowered, via a new oil tax.  Since the government is seeking
to raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did,
what  can we call this except the ""moral equivalent of civil
war--the government against its own people?""
 
     And, classically, in international trade, can you imag-
ine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to
court  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too
cheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be
compelled by the court to raise its prices, but also that it
be punished for the act of lowering them in the first place?
 
     So  while the statists could afford to take a couple of
hundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--we
certainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of
stability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  there
exists  almost  a  ""black  hole""  effect in the evolution of
nation-states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free-
dom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent,  the  state
warps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to
the degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomes
all but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seen
in the area of so-called ""welfare"" payments.  When those who
sup  at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) those
whose taxes must replenish the trough,  then  what  possible
choice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak-
ing  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many?  Go
down to the nearest ""welfare"" office, find just  two  people
on  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form
a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question
of who owns your life--and the fruits of your life's labor.
 
     So essentially those who love liberty need an ""edge"" of
some  sort  if  we're ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi-
ously  can't  use  the  altruists'  ""other-directedness""  of
""work,  slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation of
a billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world.""
Recognize  that, however immoral such an appeal might be, it
is nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today's culture.
If you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a
""cause,"" caring only enough for their personal welfare so as
to  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue
working--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy
to draw from.  Equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap-
peal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or
libertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonight
and say something like, ""Listen, follow me as I enunciate my
noble ""cause,"" contribute your money to support the ""cause,""
give  up  your  free  time  to  work for the ""cause,"" strive
selflessly to bring it about, and then (after you  and  your
children are dead) maybe your children's children will actu-
ally  live under egoism""--you'd all think I'd gone mad.  And
of course you'd be right.  Because the point I'm  trying  to
make is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if,
when, and as, individual libertarians and/or egoists find it
profitable and/or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  only
then.
 
     While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli-
tical  action, I don't believe that it is the only, nor even
necessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasing
freedom  in  our time.  Consider that, for a fraction of the
investment in time, money and effort I might expend in  try-
ing  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all
forms of censorship--I can teach every libertarian who's in-
terested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them
unilaterally.
 
     There  is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to
the Eskimoes, which very likely most Libertarians  have  al-
ready  heard.    And while you likely would not quarrel with
the saying, you might well feel that you've heard  it  often
enough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us,
and moreover, that maybe you're even tired of hearing it.  I
shall therefore repeat it now:
 
     If you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed him
for a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him
for a lifetime.
 
     Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of
a  ""workfare""  vs.  ""welfare""  context;  namely, that if you
genuinely wish to help someone in need, you should teach him
how to earn his sustenance, not simply how to  beg  for  it.
And of course this is true, if only because the next time he
is hungry, there might not be anybody around willing or even
able to give him a fish, whereas with the information on how
to fish, he is completely self sufficient.
 
     But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first order
content of the quote, and if there were nothing  further  to
glean  from  it,  I would have wasted your time by citing it
again.  After all, it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist
slant, as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac-
tivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry
beggars as we may encounter.
 
     But consider:
 
     Suppose this Eskimo doesn't know how to  fish,  but  he
does  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You, on the other hand,
have often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country
because  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things, and
they ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  suppose
the  two  of  you  decide to exchange information, bartering
fishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well,  the  first
thing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type
categorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premise
that  every  trade  must  have a ""winner"" and a ""loser;"" the
idea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the
""expense"" of another person who loses.  Clearly, under  this
scenario, such is not the case.  Each party has gained some-
thing  he  did  not have before, and neither has been dimin-
ished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information
(rather  than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sum
game.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The  ""law  of
diminishing   returns,""   the  ""first  and  second  laws  of
thermodynamics""--all those ""laws"" which constrain our possi-
bilities in other contexts--no longer bind us!   Now  that's
anarchy!
 
     Or  consider  another possibility:  Suppose this hungry
Eskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his
nation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fish
contain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, he
tells us, the state has decreed that their  consumption--and
even  their  possession--are  too  hazardous to the people's
health to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable,  willing
adults.   Perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thought
to be government property, and therefore it is the  function
of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern-
ment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener-
ously extends to competent adults the ""benefits"" it provides
to children and to the mentally ill:  namely,  a  full-time,
all-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need
not  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior
thought physically risky or morally ""naughty.""  But, in  any
case,  you  stare stupefied, while your Eskimo informant re-
lates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of
his was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of ""pos-
session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute.""
 
     Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely
oppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an
affront to the dignity of all human beings.  You may go far-
ther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion-
ary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting
this tyrant's goal.  (Your rationale may be ""altruistic""  in
the   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed,  or
""egoistic"" in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the
oppressor--or  very likely some combination of these or per-
haps even other motives.)
 
     But, since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to
your ""cause,"" you're not about to mount a military campaign,
or  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade.
However, it is here that technology--and in  particular  in-
formation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a
hundredfold.    I say ""literally,"" because for a fraction of
the effort (and virtually none of  the  risk)  attendant  to
smuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce a
hundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.  (If the tar-
geted government, like present-day America, at least permits
open  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re-
stricted,  then that should suffice.  But, if the government
attempts to suppress the flow of information as  well,  then
you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write
your  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to
your mythical Eskimo's public-key parameters.  But as far as
increasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuine
nonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as others
re-disseminate the information you have provided.   And  you
have not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id-
eological  adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde-
cided.  Recall Harry Browne's dictum  from  ""Freedom  in  an
Unfree World"" that the success of any endeavor is in general
inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua-
sion is necessary to its fulfilment.
 
     If  you  look  at  history, you cannot deny that it has
been dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington,
Lincoln,  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . .
Khadaffi . . .  and their ilk.  But it has also been  shaped
by  people with names like Edison, Curie, Marconi, Tesla and
Wozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per-
vasive, and not nearly so bloody.
 
     And  that's  where  I'm  trying  to  take The LiberTech
Project.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en-
slave, plunder or constrain us, I propose a libertarian net-
work spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize
freedom for ourselves.
 
     But here we must be a bit careful.  While it is not (at
present)  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government
wants to spy on you, there is no guarantee of what  the  fu-
ture  may hold.  There have been bills introduced, for exam-
ple, which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor
when government wants to shoot you.  That is, if you were to
commit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest, then that
fact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own.
This law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  but
it does indicate how government thinks.
 
     Other  technological  applications,  however, do indeed
pose legal risks.  We recognize, for  example,  that  anyone
who  helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the ""underground
railroad"" was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as
the sovereign government of the United States of America  at
that time found the buying and selling of human beings quite
as  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi-
larly, during Prohibition, anyone who used  his  bathtub  to
ferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug,
alcohol--the controlled substance, wine--was using  technol-
ogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents
for his ""crime""--unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life
when  Congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of this
drug.
 
     So . . . to quote a former President,  un-indicted  co-
conspirator  and pardoned felon . . . ""Let me make one thing
perfectly clear:""  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate,
participate  in, or conspire in the violation of any law--no
matter how oppressive,  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid
such  law may be.  It does engage in description (for educa-
tional and informational  purposes  only)  of  technological
processes,  and some of these processes (like flying a plane
or manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li-
censing to perform legally.    Fortunately,  no  license  is
needed  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it-
self.
 
     So, the next time you look at the political  scene  and
despair,  thinking,  ""Well,  if 51% of the nation and 51% of
this State, and 51% of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian
before  I'll  be  free,  then  somebody might as well cut my
goddamn throat now, and put me out of my  misery""--recognize
that  such  is not the case.  There exist ways to make your-
self free.
 
     If you wish to explore such techniques via the Project,
you are welcome to give me your name and address--or a  fake
name  and  mail  drop, for that matter--and you'll go on the
mailing list for my erratically-published newsletter.    Any
friends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interested
are welcome as well.  I'm not even asking for stamped  self-
addressed envelopes, since my printer can handle mailing la-
bels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared
with  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out.   If you
should have an idea to share, or even a  useful  product  to
plug,  I'll be glad to have you write it up for publication.
Even if you want to be the proverbial ""free rider"" and  just
benefit  from  what others contribute--you're still welcome:
Everything will be public domain; feel free to  copy  it  or
give it away (or sell it, for that matter, 'cause if you can
get  money  for  it while I'm taking full-page ads trying to
give it away, you're certainly entitled to  your  capitalist
profit . . .)  Anyway, every application of these principles
should make the world just a little freer, and I'm certainly
willing to underwrite that, at least for the forseeable  fu-
ture.
 
     I  will leave you with one final thought:  If you don't
learn how to beat your plowshares into  swords  before  they

Welcome to the cypherpunks mailing list.

We have a real mailing list now, and not just a mail alias on my
account.  Thanks to John Gilmore for space on hoptoad and Hugh Daniel
for setting things up.

Mail to the list members at

	cypherpunks@toad.com

Request additions or deletions, talk to the list maintainer (me, Eric
Hughes) at

	cypherpunks-request@toad.com

Tell your friends about the list and have them join if they wish, and
have them do the same, but please do not post the list address yet.
We'd like to have a core group working before we advertise to avoid
diffusion of interest at the outset.

ANNOUNCEMENT

Second Meeting -- October 10, 1992


The second meeting will be held at the new Cygnus offices.  Exact
address and directions to follow.

We do not have an exact agenda yet, but one should be arriving in the
next few days.  Please mark you calendars now and start telling your
friends.

For this meeting and until further announced, we are using a
transitive trust system for invitations.  Invite anybody you want and
let them invite anybody they want and so on.

The crypto-anarchy game we tried out at the first meeting was as good
a success as we could have hoped for from an untested idea.  The game
seems useful and fun enough to warrant continued play and play
testing, so we'll be playing again at this and future meetings.  

We observed several interesting emergent behaviors in the first
session, including resellers and reputation behaviors.  We'll play a
two hour session this time and discuss it afterwards.

The Telecommunications Radio Project at KPFA is producing a series of
thirteen hour-long radio programs on issues in communications.  The
first program is on the FBI's `Digital Telephony' e-z-wiretap proposal
and the politics of encryption.

The first half-hour will be an introduction and a panel discussion,
featuring Jim Bidzos of RSA Data Security; Jim Kalstrom, head of
investigative technology for the FBI; and me, representing the
Electronic Frontier Foundation.  You can phone in questions and comments
in the second half of the show.  The call-in number is:

	+1 800 464 5732

This program will be broadcast live on Wed, September 23, at noon, on
these California stations:

	KPFA	Berkeley
	KPFK	Los Angeles
	KHSU	Arcata

These other stations will be picking up the broadcast, 
and probably transmitting it at a later time.  Phone the station to find
out when it's scheduled.

KMUD	Redway, California	KCBL	Sacramento, California
KPBS	San Diego, California	WMNF	Tampa, Florida
KSUI	Iowa City, Iowa		KSAI	Minneapolis, Minnesota

WXXI	Rochester, New York	WEOS	Geneva, New York
KRCL	Salt Lake City, Utah	KPBX	Spokane, Washington
KUOW	Seattle, Washington

If you are not with in reach of a station that is broadcasting the
Communications Revolution, please call your local station and pitch it
to the program director.  Have them call the Telecommincations Radio
Project at KPFA, at +1 510 848 6767 x263 or x264.

Future shows (Wednesdays at noon) will cover isses like how the concept
of libraries is changing; what information is availible to (and held
back from) the public; and electronic democracy where the voters can
feed back directly to goverment agencies or change the outcome of an
election via computer networks.

Please tune in, and phone in good questions.  See you in the airwaves!

This is my first test of this list...hope it works...and a brief
opinion on the KPFA (etc.) interview with our own John Gilmore,
representing the EFF, Jim Bidzos, of RSA Data Security, and Jim
Kellstrom (sp?) of the FBI.

I made a tape of it and can bring it to the 10/10/92 crypto meeting.

John did an excellent job of raising the constitutional issues, while
the FBI guy basically said ""Trust us."" Jim Bidzos of RSA Data Security
didn't say much, as the thrust of the discussion was more on
wiretapping and the proposed Digital Telephony bill, with not much of
substance said about RSA and public key cryptography.

I waited on the 1-800-464-5732 line to ask about the status of use of
encryption, especially with RSA and RSA-like systems, but the show ran
out of time before I could get on.

This series seems timely. Every Wednesday at noon on KPFA. Check your
local listings and the announcement list John sent out a few days ago.

How to Make an Automated Remailer in Your Copious Spare Time with Easy
to Find and Inexpensive Software Tools You May Have Lying Around.

<reprinted from Popular Cryptography, September 1992. Used with permission>


The basic remailer illustrates how to hook in automated software
processing into the Unix mail system.  Here are the basic elements.

1. .forward
2. slocal and .maildelivery
3. remail.perl
4. /usr/lib/sendmail

--------------------------------------------
1. .forward

Unix mail provides a way to have accounts on many different machines
but to receive all your mail in one place.  That facility is the
.forward file, which resides in the home directory.  The file is one
line long and contains the email address to which the mail will be
forwarded.

But the .forward file has another mode of operation.  If the string
begins with the pipe character '|', the mail will be piped through the
program listed.  Enclose the string with double quotes if you need
spaces included.  Here is my .forward file:

""| /usr/local/lib/mh/slocal -user hughes""

Thus all my mail gets processed by the slocal program, described next.

I don't know where the man page for .forward is.  Perhaps someone
could provide a reference.

---------

2. slocal and .maildelivery

The software system MH contains a bunch of useful tools for handling
mail, only one of which we need.  For details on MH, do 'man mh'.

MH has a nice little mail hook processor called slocal.  Its docs can
be found by 'man mhook'.  slocal can conditionally perform operations
on mail messages and consider them either delivered or not.  It allows
multiple operations on individual mail messages.

slocal reads the file .maildelivery when it starts up for
instructions. Here is my .maildelivery file:

#
# field			pattern	action/	string 
#				result	(quote included spaces)
#
Request-Remailing-To	""""	pipe R	""perl remail.perl"" 
Request-Remailing-To	""""	file R	archive.remailer

The various pieces of the .maildelivery file are fully documented in
the man page.  I'll just explain what mine does.  Each line describes
one operation to be performed on each incoming mail message.  Fields
are separated by whitespace, so if you need to include spaces, use
quotes.

The first field, labelled field, is the mail header field to look for.
slocal can selectively process on any header line.  If the header line
does not exist, then the mail does not match this line and no
operation is performed.  If the header line does exist, processing
continues.

The second field, pattern, is a text string to match with the contents
of that header line, i.e. with everything after the colon.  In my
case, I put the empty string in, which matches everything.  You need
the pair of quotes to have a placeholder for the field contents.

The next field, action, tells what to do with the message.  'pipe'
sends the message to the standard input of the named program.  'file'
appends the message to an archive or log file.  A useful pipe command
for testing is ""tee foo"", which makes a copy of the message in file
foo, but does not append, so that you get an exact copy of what slocal
is going to pass to your pipe.  This allows testing of the pipe
program without sending yourself mail all the time.

The next field, result, tells what to do with the message after
processing.  I am currently using R for Regardless to indicate that
this action should always be performed no matter what.  The code R
indicates that the mail should be considered not delivered after
processing; thus slocal writes the mail back into my local spool and I
see it as normal.  Later, after I'm sick of looking at all the
forwarded mail, I'll change this code to A, meaning if the processing
succeeds, then the mail is considered delivered.  The archive file
will always remain R.

The last field, string, is the parameter to the action.  It is a file
name or program.  Use quotes to include spaces.  The name of my mail
processor is ""perl remail.perl"", which is to run the perl script
remail.perl on the mail.

The .maildelivery file is also the place to put encryption hooks to
automatically decrypt the bodies of messages.  More on that in a
future version.

---------

3. remail.perl

Perl is a wonderful language for doing all sorts of useful work like
processing mail headers.  Do 'man perl' for details, or get the
O'Reilly book and really learn how to use it.

The perl script, in summary, strips off the mail headers, saving the
Subject: line, rewrites a new header, and appends the body of the
previous message.  Here is the script:

--------- cut here ---------
while (<>) {
	last if /^$/ ;
	$subject = $_ if /^Subject:/ ;
	if (/^Request-Remailing-To:/) {
		chop ;
		s/^.*:// ;
		$addressee = $_ ;
	}
}

#open( OUTPUT, "">foo"" ) || die ""Cannot open 'foo'."" ;
open( OUTPUT, ""| /usr/lib/sendmail "" . $addressee ) ;
select( OUTPUT ) ;

print ""To:"" . $addressee . ""\n"" ;
print ""From: nobody\n"" ;
print $subject ;
print ""Remailed-By: Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>\n"" ;
print ""\n"" ;

while (<>) {
} continue {
	print ;
}
--------- cut here ---------

Here is a summary of the operation.  To really understand this, you'll
have to learn perl.

The while loop processes standard input.  'last' terminates the loop
as soon as a blank line is seen.  A blank line separates the header
from the body.  The subject line, if seen, sets the subject variable
to the whole subject line.  The Request- header line has its final
newline removed, the contents up to the colon substituted into
nonexistence, and saves the rest in the addressee variable.

Next the pipe to sendmail is opened and its output is selected so that
all print commands will go to the pipe.  There is a comment for a
different output channel to the file foo which can be commented in for
testing.

Next the remailed header is constructed out of print statements.

Lastly the rest of the standard input is passed through unmodified to
the output channel.  The while loop terminates when there is no more
input.

---------

4. sendmail

sendmail is the backend mailer; it expects complete mail messages and
does not usually generate any line itself except for the first ""From""
(with no colon) line.  Any header you construct will thus get passed
through mostly unmodified.  Hence you can put in any ""From:"" line you
want and any other header info, such as my ""Remailed-By:"" line.

sendmail expects the name of the addressee on its command line,
otherwise it puts an ""Apparently-To:"" line in the header.

Any mail processor which remails should probably go through sendmail,
although it would also be possible to talk to an SMTP port directly,
were you so motivated.  MH also has some remailing programs; see 'man
mhook'.

---------

A few words for tinkerers.

-- You can always send mail to yourself.  Especially after you've done
one kind of mail processing and want to pass the mail through the
filters again.

-- When getting started, create an empty .maildelivery file first and
then get your .forward file working.  Test it by sending messages to
yourself.  If you're not getting them, they are going into the bit
bucket.  All your other mail will as well, in this case, so if you
can't afford to lose mail, do it right the first time or work on a
spare account.  

-- Any mail slocal does not process will get delivered as normal.
Running a remailer will not interfere with your other work.

-- Remember to use quote marks.

-- You don't need to be a sysadmin to run this kind of remailer.
There is nothing, however, to prevent a sysadmin from running this
sofware under an alias.  The sysadmin is also a 'trusted user' to
sendmail and can get rid of pesky ""From""-no-colon lines.

-- Perl has a random function which could be used to automatically
choose various ""From:"" lines from a database.  Remember to include
yeltsy@kremvax.rus.

-- postnews or inews could be substituted for sendmail.  Different
header lines would have to be created.  Such a service could run in
parallel with a remailer.  You too can now repost to alt.sex.bondage!


Enjoy.  And watch for interesting improvements like encryption.

HUGE TRADE IN PERSONAL FILES
By MALCOLM BROWN


Westpac, National Australia Bank, NRMA Insurance Ltd, Custom Credit
and
Citicorp are some of the big names in a damning report by the ICAC
Assistant Commissioner, Mr Adrian Roden, QC, on the unauthorised
release of
confidential government information.


Mr Roden found that there was a multi-million-dollar trade in such
information which involved public servants, including police, and
private
inquiry agents.
""""Information, from a variety of State and Commonwealth government
sources
and the private sector has been freely and regularly sold and
exchanged for
many years,"" he said. ""NSW public officials have been heavily
involved.""


Mr Roden heard 446 witnesses in public and private hearings over 168
days
before compiling his 1,300-page report.


Even so, he said, it was necessary to be selective; thousands of
private
and commercial inquiry agents had not examined.


Mr Roden found that more than 250 people had participated in the
illicit
trade or had contributed to it.

OOf these, 155 had engaged in corrupt conduct. A further 101 had
engaged in
conduct which allowed, encouraged or caused the occurrence of corrupt
conduct.


Many are NSW and Commonwealth public servants who sold information
collected by the agencies where they work, including the Roads and
Traffic
Authority (RTA), police force, Telecom and Sydney County Council.


The Attorney-General, Mr Hannaford, announced that the Director of
Public
Prosecutions had set up a task force to consider laying charges
against
more than 100 people named in the report.

HHe said many of the public servants named could expect to lose their
jobs
and that the heads of all the government departments involved had been
told
to examine the report and take action against those involved.


The Assistant Police Commissioner, Mr Col Cole, confirmed yesterday
that
five police officers had been suspended and announced that three task
forces had been set up and computer security upgraded.


Mr Hannaford foreshadowed the introduction of privacy legislation to
make
the unauthorised use of confidential information a criminal offence.


The major banks said that they could not condone what their staff had
done
but said the staff had believed that they were acting in the best
interests
of their employers and the community.


None of the banks was planning to sack staff found to be corrupt
although
several said the staff had been counselled or ""educated"".

MMr Roden said the trade involved banks, insurance companies and other
financial institutions which had provided ""a ready market"".


The link was provided by private and commercial inquiry agents. With
some
banks, codes had been used to conceal the nature of the transactions.


""As they have gone about their corrupt trade, commercial interest has
prevailed over commercial ethics, greed ha~ prevailed over public
duty;
laws and regulations designed to protect confidentiality have been
ignored,"" Mr Roden said.


""Frequently the client, generally an insurance company, bank or other
financial institution, ordered the information from the agent with a
full
appreciation of how it was to be obtained.

""""The evidence disclosed that in the collection and recovery
departments of
a number of those institutions, it has long been standard practice to
use
confidential government information . . . as a means of locating
debtors.""


Some finance and insurance companies had directed agents to keep all
references to the trade off invoices and reports.


""Some even directed that the agents falsely state the source of the
information in their reports,"" Mr Roden said.


""Some solicitors in private practice have sought and purchased
confidential
government information in circumstances in which they must have known
that
it could not have been properly obtained.""


Mr Kevin Rindfleish, an unlicensed private inquiry agent, had sold
Department of Motor Transport/Roads and Traffic Authority and social
security information ""on a large scale"". His principal client had been
the
ANZ Bank.
AA private investigator, Mr Terence John Hancock, and his company, All
Cities Investigations Pty Ltd, had sold confidential government
information
to the National Australia Bank and Westpac on a regular basis.


 Two employees of the NAB had used prior contacts to provide the bank
with
access to RTA, social security, Australia Post and immigration
information.
Between them, the employees also provided silent numbers and
information on
electricity consumers.


The Advance Bank had ""over a period of years"" obtained information
improperly released from the RTA, the Department of Social Security
and the
Department of Immigration. The practice was ""known and approved at
least to
senior management level"".


New Zealand Insurance and Manufacturers Mutual had bought confidential
government information from private investigators.


NRMA Insurance Ltd and the Government Insurance Office were ""found to
have
participated as freely in the illicit trade in confidential government
information as their more commercially orientated competitors"".


""Evidence relating to NRMA Insurance Ltd established not only that it
purchased confidential government information through private
investigators, but also that investigators were required to obtain
relevant
government information by unauthorised means if they were to retain
the
company's work.""
EEsanda Finance Corporation Ltd had bought confidential information
over at
least 23 years. Custom Credit Corporation Ltd which had engaged in the
illicit trade over ""many years"", had maintained false records to
conceal
how it obtained information.


Alston de Zilwa, former underwriter and operations manager of Citicorp
Ltd
and later, Toyota Finance Australia Limited's credit operations
manager,
had established for each of the two companies a system for obtaining
confidential information.


The companies would seek information directly from employees of the
DMA and
RTA and pay a private inquiry agent, Mr Kevin Robinson, who would
""launder""
it, then invoice the companies for the corresponding sum.


Mr Roden said that hundreds of thousands of dollars had changed hands
in
the trade uncovered. One agent had estimated that he had paid $40,000
to
$50,000 a year for Social Security information alone.


Another had said he received $100,000 over two years for government
information.
YYet another had, according to records, charged a bank $186,000 for
""inquiry
services"" over a period of 18 months.

THE CYPHERPUNK MOVEMENT
by St. Jude

I don't face-to-face all that much.  And I don't like clubs.  I was in the
Black Hole for a reason: The Screamin' Memes were in town for one night
only -- Thursday, of course.  Thursday's the night, now that the weekend
has annexed Fri. and Mon.  I was lurking in the back, hoping not to see
anybody, when the Jones brothers staked me out.  Damn.  They are deep into
the street drugs.  Keeping up with the Joneses is nigh impossible; their
most trivial chitchat is an exercise in decryption.  Eddy -- or maybe he
was being Ellis that night -- was implying something about somebody when my
right foot detonated down to its steel toe.  I looked up -- way up -- to a
face that wasn't there at all.  Just a dome of black cloth, with goggles.
Three-eyed goggles.  Ah: a Chador.  I'd heard of that.  I screamed: ""You
stomped my foot FLAT!""
   ""Sorry.""  ""Are you okay?""  ""Oh maaaang.""  Many overlapping voices, all
of them synthesized, blurted from above.  Out of two tiny speakers hanging
like earrings off a basketweave headband like a cop's belt.  The head
bowed, bringing it almost within biting range.
   ""Gah.  Ow.  Ooo.""  Pretending to be demented with pain, I lurched deep
into the Chador.  But I was cool: I was rootling in there for clues.  Ha!
Male pheromones.  Hardish male torso.  I was jostling this lumpy equipment
hanging off him, trying to get a good feel of it without alerting him.  Nuh
uh: _I_ meant electronics... what did _you_ think?  Okay: I had some data
to work with.  Male with gadgets.  Quelle surprise.
	""What the hell have you got on your feet?  HORSESHOES?""
	A voice like rushing water: ""Kothurni.""  The Chador shifted a
little...
and under his full black skirts I saw them: big weighted club-foot boots
with concealed lifts, to disguise the wearer's height.  Wicked. 
   The pain and the espionage cleared my head.  I was ready to deal.
   ""So you're protecting your meat identity, right?""
   The Chador seemed to teeter a little.  It goggled down at me as if I
were a smear on a slide.  Its third-eye goggle was a lens.  Check.  Out of
the ambient murk loomed another Chador.  Exactly the same height.  Right.
   ""How come you guys are in full drag?""
   ""We're here for a... uh... party.""  The voice from the other Chador was
a flanged saxophone, but I could swear it had a Texas accent.
   ""Rubbish.  You're having a cell meeting, right?  ""
   The near Chador, the one I had groped, seemed to teeter again.  What
sounded like a tape player on fast-forward came faintly from its interior.
An earphone? 
   The saxophone honked:  ""If I said I even understood what you meant, what
kind of a chump would that make me?"" 
   ""I could hazard a guess.  I think you're cryptoanarchists -- what I'd
call cypherpunks!""
   My Chador cracked up.  I could tell.  The farther one seemed to stiffen;
I think it was giving me a hate stare.  Hard to manage behind the whole 9
yards o' cloth. 
   ""Is that clever or what?  I'm onto you like psilocybe on cowshit, dudes.
You want to take over the world.  Haha hahaha haaaaa.""
   Both of them rocked back a little.  I went in after them. ""You want to
talk encryption schemes?  Let's talk cryptic.  Tales from the cryp'ed.  But
make it fast: The Memes are comin' on.""  Oh, I was bluffing.  I don't know
much about cryptography.  I was just 'tuding them from tech envy.  Damn:
Chadors.  And me without the first widget.
   From the far guy came a cello, very suave: ""The world has already been
taken over.  You may have noticed this.  We're just trying to get some of
it back.""  And the accent was -- Dutch?
   Bob's yr uncle.  Gotcha.  I hadn't been certain.  Maybe chadors were now
trendy club gear -- what do I know?  ""Hey -- that cello's another guy?  How
many you PACKIN' in there?""
   Out of my Chador a sawtooth rasped:  ""Variable.  People are ringing in
and out.""
   ""You're on line?""
   ""This is a bridge.  International.""  Sawtooth again.
   The cello resumed, an annoyed cello:  ""We don't believe in takeovers.
In fact, we are working to make things UNTAKEOVERABLE.""
   A theremin quivered, ""And to make the world safe for anarchy.  _We want
the air-waves, baby_.""  It snickered across many frequencies.
   The Tejana saxophone chuckled, (and an eerie treat that was, too):
""Problem is, how to guarantee privacy for pseudonyms.  So you can have a
pseudonymous economy.""
   A toad croaked: ""So, full-RSA encrypted EVERYTHING.  No back doors.
Secure digital money.  Swiss bank accounts for the millions.""
   The theremin: ""A global monetary system that makes governments obsolete.
Down come the governments.  Goodbye the feds.""  It sang, whoopingly: ""BYE
BYE, LAWWww.""  Horrible broad-band snickering.
   The toad croaked: ""Er... yes.  Real freedom of speech, too.
Libertech!""
   The Dutch cello was all business: ""Okay, what does it take?  You need
real-time protocols to prove you own your pseudonym.  And your pseudonyms
have online reputations, via people you've done biz with -- like a
distributed credit rating system.  With maybe designated angels -- Fair
Witnesses.""
   I was charmed.  ""And you wear the chador when you face-to-face somebody
who knows your handle!"" 
   The theremin wheeped: ""Actually, unmasking your real identity could be
the ultimate collateral -- your killable, _torturable_ body.  Even without
kids, you've got a hostage to fortune -- your own meat.""
   I was reeling.  ""Oh yas yas.  As Dylan said: 'They asked me for some
collateral/ and I pulled down my pants'.""
   Orchestral chuckles rained down on me.  Was I an international hit?
   But at that exact moment The Memes hit the stage.  The crowd did a 9.1
Richter lurch and the other Chador pitched onto my LEFT toe, maybe denting
the steel.
   ""AAIEEeeee.  That's great COVERT GEAR you got there, guys.  You couldn't
sneak up on Helen Keller in a HAILSTORM.""  I was trying to spin down.  ""And
dudes -- this is not the neighborhood for flashing the hardware.  Getting
rolled by winos is pretty LOW TECH.""
   A spike-knuckled glove slithered out of the farther guy, clutching what
looked, in the near-dark, like an electric razor.  ""_Gonna menace 'em with
a clean shave_?""
   The sax: ""Stunner.  Bottom of the line.  But.""  A hot line of pure
energy cracked across its little trodes.  Of course.
   Rushing water: ""See ya.""  And they did a fade into the smoke.

   The Screamin' Memes were worthless.  To hell with clubs.  To hell with
lots o' things, maybe.  I am now sensing my roots, mahn; dey who are my
bredren.  Nerds.  
   Nerds as mainstreamed by the grainy but still fetching Robt Redford in
Sneakers...  Nerds who will have their revenge at last, by making the
online realer than our current regrettable reality...  No, I'm not quite
delusional.  I've heard the cypherpunks are already distributing their
encrypted email software, which is quick and slick.  I might even join the
revolution, which is, heh, already in progress.  
   Yeah.  Why not?  Give me libertech or give me... _DES_?

"<9209251835.AA00599@soda.berkeley.edu>",15,"Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>","Fri, 25 Sep 92 11:37:12 PDT","cypherpunks@toad.com","the hopping remailer is done",,"



The hopping remailer is finished.  I wrote it this morning.

The change to make a hopping remailer is very easy.  Here's the new
perl script:

--------- cut here ---------
while (<>) {
	last if /^$/ ;
	$subject = $_ if /^Subject:/ ;
	if (/^Request-Remailing-To:/) {
		chop ;
		s/^.*:// ;
		$addressee = $_ ;
	}
}

#open( OUTPUT, "">foo"" ) || die ""Cannot open 'foo'."" ;
open( OUTPUT, ""| /usr/lib/sendmail "" . $addressee ) ;
select( OUTPUT ) ;

print ""To:"" . $addressee . ""\n"" ;
print ""From: nobody\n"" ;
print $subject ;
print ""Remailed-By: Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>\n"" ;

#
# check to see if there are header lines in the body to collapse 
#   into the full header.
#

if ( $_ = <> ) {
	if (/^##$/) {
		# do nothing if the pasting token appears
		# the rest of the body will be directly appended
		# this allows for extra header lines to be added
	} else {
		# normal line
		print ""\n"" ;
		print $_ ;
	}
} else {
	# empty body
	exit ;
}

while (<>) {
} continue {
	print ;
}
--------- cut here ---------

Short explanation.  The 'print ""\n"" ;' line was moved inside the new
if statement.  The if statement reads a line of the body and stops the
script if there is no body.  The line read is tested to see if it
contains the two characters ""##"" alone on the line.  ""##"" is the ANSI
C token pasting operator.  If there is no pasting, a blank line is
printed to mark the end of the header and the first line of the body
is printed.  If there is pasting, then the conditional does nothing,
which has the effect that the body is appended directly onto the end
of the header, allowing you to add more header lines after the header
is rewritten.


Here is a sample message that I sent myself after the new script was
installed:

--------- cut here ---------
To: hughes
Subject: multiple hops
Request-Remailing-To: hughes

##
X-Hop: 1
Request-Remailing-To: hughes

##
X-Hop: 2
Request-Remailing-To: hughes

##
X-Hop: 3

This is a test message of multiple hops.

Eric
--------- cut here ---------


I received four pieces of mail after sending this to myself.  The
first was the actual letter, which is still delivering normally and
not being filtered.  The next two were the first and second
remailings; they had X-Hop: 1 and 2.  The last message was the final
one, had X-Hop: 3 in its header and was delivered normally.

At each stage, the header got rewritten and a new
Request-Remailing-To: line inserted.  When that mail got delivered, it
was again rewritten, with a new remailing request.  This process is
extensible up to the 50K or so practical limitatation on mail size.

Note that this system is not at all secure by itself.  But if each
message body were encrypted first, and the message first decrypted
before the header re-write took place, the routing instructions as a
whole would be hidden from prying eyes.

That's the next project.

Eric

Hey, Kidz....


I don't mean to point out the obvious, but when you mention a certain
scheme for secure transfer (3 initials, you guess), or a certain organization
dedicated to keeping it from the public (3 initals, you guess again),
THEY READ IT.

OK?  Did I make my point?

Most internet traffic is archived (and later Grep'd) anyway.
If you're really that worried about it, then we should have
been speaking in Aramaic all this time, or using encrypted
e-mail (and I'm sure traffic which mentions the characters
""crypt"" draws attention as well, and most of the msgs on this
mailing list have already violated that one.)  I'm interested
to see the PGP addition to the re-mailer.
 
-- Concerned, yet not overly unrealistic about it.

      Background:

      SEIZING THE MEDIA is the title of pamphlet written by the
      Immediast Underground and first released in Amsterdam ,
      New York City, and Seattle in early 1992. The 26 pamphlet
      combines theory, graphics, research and proposals that examine:

                    * Information control
                    * Propaganda and advertising
                    * CIA
                    * Mind control
                    * Immediast counter-offensives
                    * tactics, subversive networking, public empowerment
                    * multi-media
                    * Public production libraries
                    * the liberation of public space

       ...Just when Jesse Helms thought he made the world safe from
       poetic terrorism, along come the Immediasts, a cadre of media 
       hackers who are fed up with the ecology of coercion that 
       surrounds them. Their booklet SEIZING THE MEDIA proposes an 
       all-out artistic assault on coercive communication, cultural 
       monologue, and media control. They want all media insurgents 
       to take back the airwaves with pirate radio, cable access TV, 
       altering ads and billboards, and otherwise hacking the 
       datasphere to break the spell of State/corporate media control.

       THE IMMEDIAST UNDERGROUND is a centerless network of artists,
       writiers, hackers, culture jammers, pirate broadcasters, and
       posterists who connect with one another through information
       systems, mail art, networker congresses, and the underground
       press, and who communicate with the public through actions
       against all forms of coercive communication, space
       infringement, and media control.

       DECENTRALIZED WORLD-WIDE NETWORKER CONGRESSES
       Since the beginning of the year, members of alternative
       info-nets, artists, insurgents, and cultural workers have
       been holding networker congresses, transnational engagements 
       in cultural production, dialogue, collaborations, open 
       exchange, subversive brainstorming, and collective 
       disruptions of dominant culture.

       THE NETWORKER, A NEW PERCEPTION
       In societies where information is money and media is power,
       public access is as controlled as the corporate states grip 
       on communication law, censorship, commerce, covert action 
       and surveillance. In this context, uninhibited public 
       communication, expression, and cultural production are acts 
       of freedom, sovereignty, and defiance. Rooted in the drive to 
       connect and exchange with others, Networker Congress engage 
       in culture and media as the battleground for greater openness 
       and freedom.

How about the idea of a secure Internet Relay Chat?
 
A central server might maintain the list of everybody's Public Keys.
If you wanted to broadcast a 'public' yet secure msg in a particular
room making sure only participants in that room (and not eavesdroppers
somewhere else on the wire) could read the msg you could encrypt
your broadcast with the server's own Public Key.  Send it.
The Server receives it, decrypts it, then for each of the participants
currently in this particular room, the server encrypts the msg
with that person's Public Key and sends it.  Private IRC msgs
would be treated similarly, except that they'd be re-encrypted
only once, for the intended private recipient.

Anyone interested on working on this?  0r 1z 1t 2 layme?

Palo Alto, Calif., October 1, 1992 -- Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility (CPSR), the national public interest organization based
here, will take an in-depth look at its recent suit against the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) during CPSR's 1992 Annual Meeting,
October 17th and 18th at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif.
CPSR Legal Counsel, David Sobel, will talk about the FBI suit for the
first time since it was filed and moderate a panel discussion on the
politics of cryptography at the annual meeting.  The CPSR annual
meeting is a provactive two-day conference that addresses critical
issues facing society as a result of information technology.

CPSR filed suit against the FBI in September, after the Bureau failed
to make public documents that would justify the need for its new
wiretap proposal.  The FBI proposal would redesign the telephone
network to make wiretapping easier.  Recognizing the importance of
cryptography policy, CPSR catalyzed a national debate earlier this
year, as to whether or not the FBI and National Security Agency
(NSA) should be involved in setting the technical standards for the
computer and communications industry.

The panel discussion will include a screening and discussion of film
clips from the movie, Sneakers.  Panelists include, Joan Feigenbaum,
Technical Staff, Computing Principles Research, ATT Bell Labs, John
Gilmore, founder of Cygnus Support, and Dave Banisar, CPSR Policy
Analyst.

CPSR's annual meeting will  bring together computer scientists from
across the country to examine the relationship between politics and
technology.  Other topics include:

    *  Teledemocracy & Citizen Participation:
        Beyond the Electronic Town Meeting,

This session is an election year look at the dangers and the
opportunites of electronic democracy.  Speaker, Susan G. Hadden,
professor in the LBJ School of Public Affairs, University of Texas at
Austin, an expert on telecommunications and citizen participation.

    *  Everything's Digital!  Media Convergence:  Hope, Hype or Hell?

This session examines the social implications of multimedia
convergence which is the merging of computer, telephone, and video
technology.  Panel discussion with David Bunnell, Editor, New Media,
Denise Caruso, Editor, Digital Media, and Howard Rheingold, Whole
Earth Review

    *  Envisioning Technology Policy in a Democratic Society;

A panel of technologists looks at the development of American
technology policy.  Panelists include, Gary Chapman, The 21st
Century Project, Judy Stern, CPSR/Berkeley, Claire Zvanski, SEIU
Local 790.

President of Interval Research, Dave Liddle, will be the keynote
speaker at CPSR's awards banquet Saturday evening.  Liddle will be
speaking on the Computing in the 21st Century.  IBM researcher,
Barbara Simons will be presented with the 1992 Norbert Wiener
Award for Social and Professional Responsibility in Computing.

Founded in 1981, CPSR is a national, non-profit, public interest
organization of computer scientists and other professionals concerned
with the impact of computer technology on society.  With offices in
Washington, D.C. and Boston, CPSR's members provide the public and
policy makers with expert testimony and assessments on the power, promise, and
 limitations of computer technology.

Interesting ideas so far... Hey, anyone see the Quantum Crypto article in
October Scientific AMerican?  Of course the approach isn't practical at this
point, and doing it over fiber optics won't be any better since the
amplification along the way would raise the quantum process to the classical
level and destroy its value... but even so, interesting as theory...

 U> How about the idea of a secure Internet Relay Chat?

I'm fairly interested... version 2 of PGP is generating some interest here in the FidoNet, though it has some serious problems, design problems. (It's ""ASCII armor"" method (ala UUENCODE) is delicate and fussy, for example).

I am considering becoming and ""introducer"" for parts of FidoNet. I can't seem to get past the problems of how to assign reliability to public keys I receive over an unsecured email channel to begin with.  No other method is practical.

Alas, I can't take part in much it seems, the UFGATE was hobbled to intentionally prevent us FidoNet people from entering text into message headers (For example ""Request-Remailing-To:""...) because we'd take over the planet or something I guess (we are apparently contagious).

Doesn't this imply that the unencrypted message would have to travel from the originator to the server? Or do you mean to send to X I'd request X's public key from the server, then encrypt, etc?

Hacking ingenuity...

=================[ Cut Here ]====================

                  The /etc/passwd cracker service


   Have you ever been troubled by those DES encrypted passwords in the
   /etc/passwd file of your favourite machine ? Worry no more !


What's up ?

   Utopia now has a unique, probably the first in the world,
   password-hacking mailserver. This server compares the encrypted string
   in the /etc/passwd with a 3Mb dictionary, the gecos-field and username.
   The dictionary consists of +- 50.000 english words, +-50.000 dutch
   words, sf-authors, girlnames and some other stuff that people tend to
   use as passwords.

   The dictionary check is done by the very fast HADES hacking engine.
   I was surprised by the speed of hades ! The gecos and username
   scanning is done by the adapted berkeley hacker , this one also appends
   0-9 to the end of the guess, and checks upper/lower case and words
   without vowels.


How it works:

   You need access to some form of uucp/internet mail facilities to use
   the server. Fidonet-users can use the fido <-> internet gateway,
   a helpfile for this gateway can be found somewhere on utopia, and on
   many other systems in cyberspace.


   send your /etc/passwd to: cracker@utopia.hacktic.nl


   The cracker will automagically try to guess the passwords in the
   passwd file, and send you back any results it found to the E-mail
   adress the file came from.


Illegal ?

   Ofcourse you yourselfe are entirely responsible for your actions, I
   really don't care what you do with any passwords from any hacked
   account. I trust you to only use this server for 'educational
   purposes' :) Read the boiler-plate on Utopia to have deeper insight
   in any legal-issues. Furthermore you should read the disclaimer that
   comes with the HADES password hacker.


Thanks:

   Thanks go to Zakbar & Remote for making the HADES hacker, to ITSME
   for the msdos-berkeley hacker, to Rop for the original idea and to
   the cockroaches in my house for entertaining me in those early
   hours.

attention all public-key encryption buffs:

a new Echo has been started for discussion and distribution of public-key encryption info. since it was only born a couple hours ago, it is being distributed privately from 1:374/14 [9600+ HST/V32] and 1:374/26 [2400].

 here are the details from the EListing:

area  PUBLIC_KEYS

title  Public-Key Encryption and Distribution Echo

desc  Provides a technical forum for discussion of public-key desc  encryption techniques and programs and for the distribution desc  of public-keys in FidoNet and other BBS and e-mail networks.  desc  PUBLIC_KEYS is Moderated by Christopher Baker at 1:374/14 desc  [KeyID: 1024/4B9A59] and GK Pace at 1:374/26 [KeyID: desc  1024/B6B823].

here's the info from the .RUL file to be found in ELRUL as of 11/92:



This is the PUBLIC_KEYS Echo. The purpose of the Echo is to provide a place to post and find public-keys for data encryption within FidoNet and elsewhere and to discuss data and software encryption and the various schemes thereof.

 This is a technical Echo with very few rules. Those very few rules are:

1. Stay on-topic. Topics of keys and encryption are welcome. Others are not.

 2. No politics [except as it relates to privacy issues] and no religion.

 3. No personal attacks, slurs or innuendo. Stick to issues not

  personalities.

 4. No Private flagged messages in Echomail! Encrypted traffic using

  public-keys is permitted for the exercise so long as it is on-topic.

 5. This Echo may be traveling around the world so try to be concise. Avoid

  excessive quoting for one-liner responses.

 6. Be aware that Echomail is NOT secure. Don't take anything at face value.

 7. The posts in this Echo are the sole responsiblity of the poster. If you

  need verification, use Netmail.

 8. The Moderators will deal with off-topic traffic. Don't respond for them.

  Links to this Echo will only be curtailed when absolutely necessary so

  please don't make it necessary. [grin]

The Moderators are Christopher Baker [KeyID: 1024/4B9A59 1992/10/03] and GK Pace [KeyID: 1024/B6B823 1992/09/28] at 1:374/14 and 1:374/26, respectively.

 It is recommended that public-keys be made available via Netmail or by file-request with the magic filename: PGPKEY and that the public-key provided for that request by given a distinctive filename using part or all of each provider's name and address. For example, on my system, a file-request of PGPKEY will give BAK37414.ASC to the requesting system. This will avoid duplicate overwriting and make it easier to track the keys. Using a standard magic filename will make it easier to find keys on different systems.

 This Echo is not currently on the Zone 1 Backbone distribution list but that is expected to change as soon as the word gets out. This Echo will be EListed in ELIST211 next month. Please feel free to announce and distribute this Echo to all interested participants in your area.

 Thanks.

 TTFN.  Christopher Baker & GK Pace Moderators

any questions? anyone with Areafix already set for this system or for 1:374/26 may link in remotely. all others need to send a Netmail request. the Echo will be distributed privately until it is large enough for moving to the Zone 1 Backbone [or any other Backbones who want to get into it].

 thanks.

from the originator to the server? Or do you mean to send to X I'd

<<
 
Not at all.  In its simplest form: We'd have a single
secure-IRC-server.  It would have its own public key, which ever
secure-IRC-client would know.  When I want to send a secure
broadcast msg, I type it, my client encrypts it with the public key of
the secure-IRC-server, and transmits it.  The server picks it up,
decrypts it in memory, then re-encrypts that original msg with the
public key of each paritxxx participant in the particular room I'm in.
So, if there are ten participants in the room, and I want all of them
to know something, but not anyone else who might be tapping ixxx wires
or catching packets somewhere in the ether, then I'd send a single
broadcast msg to the server; the server would end up sending ten
differently encrypted msgs -- one to each participant, encrypted with
each of the participants' public keys (which the secure-irc-server
would have to maintain; it would function as a key-server.)
 
To send a private msg across the secure-IRC, I'd indicate that it was
a ""/msg"", the recipeixxx recipient, and again, encrypt it with the
public key of the server.  The server would learn who the recipient
was, and rebroadcast my message to that person, in that person's
public key.

Huh?  I don't understand what you're pointing out.  If I send you my
public key -- even if I cc: dockmaster -- what does it matter that the
NSA knows my public key (unoless they want to send me msgs, too)?  The
key itself is inherantly secure.  Let your users decide on their
public keys and register those keys with your key server.  Not the

Providing the numbe r of cells you have access to and can anticipate

Anyway, look, let's put our words into action.  What makes code
(programming, I mean) didxxx different from spoken language?  The fact
that you can communicate with a machine, and it will _act_ on what you
say, no matter what.  Theres beauty and there's magic in that.  (And
some of us have the same effect on people that we have on machines.
;-)) Instead of talking about all this, let's start doing it.  What
did I read the other day?  ""Hackers go where Angels fear to tread""?
Let's have more ideas.  This hopping remailer is exciting.  So is
passive encryption of electronic communications.  When are we going
totart xxx to start effecting de facto standards here?  Once we start
encrypting everything, then what?  What do we do with this new tool?
Communication of any kind (especially encrypted communication)
presupposs that there are messages to be exchanged -- _ideas_!  More
ideas and less chatter.
 
How can we have a revolution if we don't even know what we're trying

The problem with central servers is that they are prone to single
point failure.  That failure may be computer down or key compromise.
A good criterion for this kind of design is not to use central
servers.  This is almost always possible.  (Or always possible,
depending on who you ask.)

There is also the question about getting permission to enter a room,
which corresponds to an authentication or a key distribution or a
voting algorithm or some sort.  You need to know how you want that
_social_ interaction to work before you design protocols.  You should
implement that sociality and test it without encryption to make sure
it's what you want.  Is this sounding familiar?

Building a key distribution system takes time.  Start off by having
people mail you diskettes.  Or if you don't mind typing, printouts.
Carry copies of your public key to give to people in person.

Get good security is not free, especially in terms of time.

If you can personally receive via out-of-band channels the public key
of another introducer, you can exchange all the certified keys you
each possess.  And then exchange those with another introducer you know.

Introducers are not a special breed.  Most people should certify
others public keys, if only for redundancy.

Remember, no one has ever set up a non-hierarchical public key
distribution system to the general public.  This is research.

You aren't the only one Tom.  Apparently lots of Unix mail interfaces
don't let you arbitrarily edit the header or add lines.

I'm going to add a facility to make this possible for everyone.  The
design I have in mind uses only the message body.  No need to touch
the header.

Let's make this short.

The basic problem with public key systems is to make sure that what
_I_ think is my public key is the same thing as what _you_ think is my
public key.

If these are not the same, something is wrong.  At worst, an
interposer is getting all your mail, decrypting with one public key
and encrypting with a different one.

Servers, generally, are not desirable because they are too prone to
communications filters of the above sort.

For a more detailed reference, read the excellent introduction to the
whole topic of public key distribution in the PGP 2.0 documentation.


>Course, there's always the Kandinsky-Ogorov method of key exchange.

Please elaborate.

The cypherpunks list is a forum for discussion about technological
defenses for privacy in the digital domain.  

Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were more
of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy must
create it for themselves and not expect governments, corporations, or
other large, faceless organizations to grant them privacy out of
beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people have been creating their
own privacy for centuries with whispers, envelopes, closed doors, and
couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek to prevent other people from
speaking about their experiences or their opinions.

The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption. To
encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  But to encrypt with
weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for privacy.
Cypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will learn how best
to defend it.

Cypherpunks are therefore devoted to cryptography.  Cypherpunks wish
to learn about it, to teach it, to implement it, and to make more of
it.  Cypherpunks know that cryptographic protocols make social
structures.  Cypherpunks know how to attack a system and how to
defend it.  Cypherpunks know just how hard it is to make good
cryptosystems.

Cypherpunks love to practice.  They love to play with public key
cryptography.  They love to play with anonymous and pseudonymous mail
forwarding and delivery.  They love to play with DC-nets.  They love
to play with secure communications of all kinds.

Cypherpunks write code.  They know that someone has to write code to
defend privacy, and since it's their privacy, their going to write
it.  Cypherpunks publish their code so that their fellow cypherpunks
may practice and play with it.  Cypherpunks realize that security is
not built in a day and are patient with incremental progress.

Cypherpunks don't care if you don't like the software they write. 
Cypherpunks know that software can't be destroyed.  Cypherpunks know
that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down.

Cypherpunks will make the networks safe for privacy.

The second meeting of the cypherpunks will be Saturday at noon.  John
Gilmore has graciously provided us with a meeting space at the new
Cygnus Support offices.  These offices are so new, in fact, that
Cygnus will not have moved in yet.  This meeting will be

empty space.  Directions are at the end of the message.

Attendance is transitive trust, arbitrarily deep.  Invite whoever you
want, and let them do so also, and so on.  Invite them also to join
the mailing list.  Do not, however, just post the announcement.  Time
for that will come.

I'd like everyone who plans on attending the meeting to send me,
hughes@soda.berkeley.edu, a message telling me so.  I'd like to get a
rough head count before Saturday for game planning.

We are starting at noon because of popular demand.  Eat beforehand or
bring a burrito or something.  It will be fine to eat during the first
segment; it won't be any more disruptive than the game is.

Bring your PGP public key for in-person key distribution, preferably
on diskette.  We'll need a portable PC or three to do key
distribution; if you have one you can bring, post to the list and tell
people.

We realized after the first meeting that a strict schedule was
nonsense.  This meeting has a very informal schedule.


Schedule
--------

Starting at noon, we're going to play session two of the
crypto-anarchy game, in which players try to conduct business under
the watchful eyes of others.  We want to play for two hours and then
have discuss experiences afterward for about an hour.  Some of the
improvements over last time will be flatter denominations of money,
wider distribution of commodities, more watchers (governmental and
otherwise), and perhaps some pre-printed forms.

We'll take a break to regroup for about ten or twenty minutes.

For the second half we'll talk about the security of remailers.  I'll
lead the discussion.  We'll be designing protocols and analyzing
attacks and defenses.  I've done this with DigiCash for electronic
money protocols, and remailers are much easier, but still probably
more than an afternoon's discussion.  We'll do this until six or so,
when people will have to start leaving.

Everyone who wants to will go out for dinner.  I don't know the
restaurants down there; perhaps someone could suggest one?


Directions
----------
It's at 1937 Landings Drive, Mt. View.  101 to Amphitheatre Parkway
(the bay side of Rengstorff Ave), go right at the first light,
pass a right turn, and just before the road crests a tiny hill,
turn right into the Landings complex.  We're in Building H.

I am way excited to see this all coming together!  It's like a 13-year-
old dream-come-true!

This is a great statement of purpose, though I might leave ""DC-nets"" out
(since many won't know what that means) and perhaps replace it with the
only slightly-less-cryptic ""information-theoretically-secure networks"",
or some such.

      Background:

      SEIZING THE MEDIA is the title of pamphlet written by the
      Immediast Underground and first released in Amsterdam ,
      New York City, and Seattle in early 1992. The 26 pamphlet
      combines theory, graphics, research and proposals that examine:

                    * Information control
                    * Propaganda and advertising
                    * CIA
                    * Mind control
                    * Immediast counter-offensives
                    * tactics, subversive networking, public empowerment
                    * multi-media
                    * Public production libraries
                    * the liberation of public space

       ...Just when Jesse Helms thought he made the world safe from
       poetic terrorism, along come the Immediasts, a cadre of media 
       hackers who are fed up with the ecology of coercion that 
       surrounds them. Their booklet SEIZING THE MEDIA proposes an 
       all-out artistic assault on coercive communication, cultural 
       monologue, and media control. They want all media insurgents 
       to take back the airwaves with pirate radio, cable access TV, 
       altering ads and billboards, and otherwise hacking the 
       datasphere to break the spell of State/corporate media control.
	  . . . from Gareth Branwyns STREET NOISE, Issue 7 of Mondo 2000

       SEIZING THE MEDIA Version 1.1 is available for $3 from
       Open Media PO Box 2726  Westfield New Jersey 07091 USA

       THE IMMEDIAST UNDERGROUND is a centerless network of artists,
       writiers, hackers, culture jammers, pirate broadcasters, and
       posterists who connect with one another through information
       systems, mail art, networker congresses, and the underground
       press, and who communicate with the public through actions
       against all forms of coercive communication, space
       infringement, and media control.

       DECENTRALIZED WORLD-WIDE NETWORKER CONGRESSES
       Since the beginning of the year, members of alternative
       info-nets, artists, insurgents, and cultural workers have
       been holding networker congresses, transnational engagements 
       in cultural production, dialogue, collaborations, open 
       exchange, subversive brainstorming, and collective 
       disruptions of dominant culture.

       THE NETWORKER, A NEW PERCEPTION
       In societies where information is money and media is power,
       public access is as controlled as the corporate states grip 
       on communication law, censorship, commerce, covert action 
       and surveillance. In this context, uninhibited public 
       communication, expression, and cultural production are acts 
       of freedom, sovereignty, and defiance. Rooted in the drive to 
       connect and exchange with others, Networker Congress engage 
       in culture and media as the battleground for greater openness 
       and freedom.

   I am the moderator of the Computer Privacy Digest.  The computer
   Privacy Digest is an Internet mailing list that is dedicated to the
   discussion of how technology impacts privacy.  This list is
gatewayed
   into the moderated USENET newsgroup comp.society.privacy.  In lot
of
   ways it is a subsection on the risks digest but it concentrates on
   the risks of technology on privacy.  The charter is:
 
   comp.society.privacy    Effects of technology on privacy
(Moderated)
 
   This newsgroup is to provide a forum for discussion on the effect
of
   technology on privacy. All too often technology is way ahead of the
   law and society as it presents us with new devices and
   applications.  Technology can enhance and detract from privacy.
   This newsgroup will be gatewayed to an internet mailing list.

I am considering becoming and ""introducer"" for parts of FidoNet. I
can't seem to get past the problems of how to assign reliability to
public keys I receive over an unsecured email channel to begin with.
No other method is practical.
<<
 
>>??
Huh?  I don't understand what you're pointing out.  If I send you my
public key -- even if I cc: dockmaster -- what does it matter that the
NSA knows my public key (unoless they want to send me msgs, too)? 
<<

Not my worry. What I meant was, how do I know htat the keyfile I
received from ""John Smith @ net address"" really is his, and not some
faker. Short of physically getting key disks from someone face to
face (flatly im-possible here), I don't know.

The assurance of course is the social system: if someone sends me a
message and keyfile, ""here's my file, my name is Eric Hughes"", and I
distribute it...

I can think of no way to prevent this, other than let a social system
detect and repair -- ""HEY THATS NOT ME!!!"" form the 'real' you would
raise a flag... and an audit trail at the introducers site
(dangerous...!) might help.

Anyhoo, that's what I meant.

you just buy an individuals public key from several of these

In large part the electronic environment is already pseudonymous.  I
don't know most Usenet posters personally and never will.  I have no
need to personally verify their identities; in fact, I don't even want
to.

But for someone I'm going to deal with over a period of time, I do
want to make sure that it's the same person I'm dealing with each
time.  And if I never happen to meet this person face to face, or need
to know anything about this person as a physical being, so be it.  All
I really care about is persistence, not identity.

In the elctronic world, all you have are persistent pseudonyms.  Most
of them, true, are still linked to physical people, but there is no
particular reason why that need continue.

I think the changeover point will be this.  As soon as there is money
flowing through the networks which is tied only to pseudonyms and not
to physical people, then you'll see a _lot_ more virtual-only
identities.  When you can conduct business and get paid for it,
there's a big difference.  When some of your data has negotiable cash
value, you'll see privacy and security get *important*.

And most of these identities will have regular sounding names.
Handles, a la the underground, are more a mark of social identity than
of anonymity.  The best camouflage is not to draw attention to
yourself.  When most of the world is personal, look personal.  Who
will ever know?

This is like asking ""how do I get a bullet to stop in mid air and
launch itself back into the bullet casing in the breech of the gun"".
You don't. Obviously, the only way to trust a key enough to certify it
is to actually get it in person and verify identity. This is often
impractical, but so what? If people want to communicate and the only
assurance your signature gives them is that you got a copy of the keys
by email, they might as well just email each other they keys and live
knowing that the messages they are sending are to possibly
non-securely identified people. Signed introduced keys should be
reserved for times when you can actually add real information by
claiming the key is really owned by the person who claims it.

This does mean that a lot of the time until people have built up
catenative assembleges of keys sufficent to form a ""chain of trust""
for unknown people that they will simply have to do without
certification of the other person's identity. Isn't that the way life
usually is, though?

Instead of thinking of keys as things belonging to people, we can think of
people as things associated with keys.  In fact, we just need to shift the
focus to be entirely on the keys, and leave the people out of it.

I guess I had to come at this from the backside. You are right.
Accepting keys over the network will provide reasonably well-sealed

  FROM CROSSBOWS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY:  THWARTING THE STATE VIA
                     TECHNOLOGY
 
  Given at the Future of Freedom Conference, November 1987
 
 
     You   know,   technology--and   particularly   computer
technology--has often gotten a bad rap in  Libertarian  cir-
cles.  We tend to think of Orwell's 1984, or Terry Gilliam's
Brazil,  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin's
slave/citizens on their own side of the border, or  the  so-
phisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those on
his ""enemies list.""  Or, we recognize that for the price  of
a  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of
sound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by
a  government  policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be-
longings if it beeps.
 
     But I think that mind-set is a mistake.   Before  there
were cattle prods, governments tortured their prisoners with
clubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before  there  were lasers for
eavesdropping, governments used binoculars and  lip-readers.
Though  government certainly uses technology to oppress, the
evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.
 
     In fact, technology represents one of the most  promis-
ing  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms from
those who have stolen them.  By its very nature,  it  favors
the  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can-
not).  It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  the
merit  of  the  new(  over  the sluggish (who cling to time-
tested ways).  And what two better words are  there  to  de-
scribe government bureaucracy than ""dull"" and ""sluggish""?
 
     One  of  the  clearest,  classic triumphs of technology
over tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portable
crossbow.   With it, an untrained peasant could now reliably
and lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  if
that  target  were  a mounted, chain-mailed knight.  (Unlike
the longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and  could
get  off  more shots per unit time, the crossbow required no
formal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  required
elaborate  visual,  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to
achieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder  of  a  crossbow
could simply put the weapon to his shoulder, sight along the
arrow  itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar-
get.)
 
     Moreover, since just about  the  only  mounted  knights
likely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government
soldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the  device  was
plain:    With it, the common rabble could defend themselves
not only against one another, but against their governmental
masters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor-
piercing  bullet,  and, consequently, kings and priests (the
medieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and
Crossbows)  threatened  death  and  excommunication, respec-
tively, for its unlawful possession.
 
     Looking at later developments, we  see  how  technology
like  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the
handgun, later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced
machine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal
and inter-group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45
called ""the equalizer.""  A frail dance-hall hostess with one
in  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself
against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise-
ments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the
repeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  ""a  man  on
horseback,  armed with one of these rifles, simply cannot be
captured.""  And, as long as his captors  were  relying  upon
flintlocks  or  single-shot rifles, the quote is doubtless a
true one.
 
     Updating now to  the  present,  the  public-key  cipher
(with  a  personal  computer to run it) represents an equiv-
alent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  can
such  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one's
own possession, but it can also permit two strangers to  ex-
change   information   over   an   insecure   communications
channel--a  wiretapped   phone   line,   for   example,   or
skywriting, for that matter)--without ever having previously
met  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand-dollar com-
puter, you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  CRAY
X-MP  can't  crack in a year.  Within a few years, it should
be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi-
cations; soon after that, full-color digitized video images.
Technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete,  it
will  have  totally demolished government's control over in-
formation transfer.
 
     I'd like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat-
ics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm is
called the RSA algorithm, after Rivest, Shamir, and  Adleman
who  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the fact
that, if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very
large  primes,  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the
two prime factors from analysis  of  their  product.    ""Ex-
tremely""  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100
digits apiece, then their 200-digit product cannot  in  gen-
eral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful
computer now in existence.
 
     The  ""public"" part of the key consists of (1) the prod-
uct  pq  of the two large primes p and q, and (2)  one  fac-
tor,  call it  x  , of the product  xy  where  xy = {(p-1) *
(q-1) + 1}.  The ""private"" part of the key consists  of  the
other factor  y.
 
     Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned
into an integer--either by using ASCII,  or  even  a  simple
A=01,  B=02,  C=03, ... , Z=26 representation.  This integer
is then raised to the power  x (modulo pq) and the resulting
integer is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiver
decrypts by taking this integer to the  (secret)  power    y
(modulo  pq).  It can be shown that this process will always
yield the original number started with.
 
     What makes this a groundbreaking development,  and  why
it  is  called  ""public-key""  cryptography,""  is  that I can
openly publish the product  pq and the number   x   ,  while
keeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send me
an encrypted message, namely
                       x
                     a    (mod pq)  ,
but only I can recover the original message  a  , by  taking
what  they  send, raising it to the power  y  and taking the
result (mod pq).  The risky step (meeting to exchange cipher
keys) has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trust
each other enough to want to meet, may  still  reliably  ex-
change  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected and
disseminated his own  pq  and his  x  ,   while  maintaining
the secrecy of his own  y.
 
     Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a ""dig-
ital signature,"" to enable one to authenticate the source of
a given message.  Normally, if I want to send you a message,
I raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  (mod
your pq)  and send that.
 
    However,  if in my message, I take the plaintext  a and
raise it to my (secret) power  y  , take the result  (mod my
pq), then raise that result to your x   (mod  your  pq)  and
send this, then even after you have normally ""decrypted"" the
message,  it  will still look like garbage.  However, if you
then raise it to my public power x   , and take  the  result
(mod  my public pq  ), so you will not only recover the ori-
ginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but I
could have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secret
y).
 
     And these are the very concerns by the way that are to-
day tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of
personal  computers.    On the one hand, they recognize that
American schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com-
puters  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so, in
fact, because there are things computers can do  which  will
interest  (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds.  And it is pre-
cisely these students who one generation hence will be going
head-to-head against their Soviet  counterparts.    For  the
Soviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to
teach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning
ballistics.    On  the  other hand, whatever else a personal
computer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copying
machine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words  of
text,  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If this
weren't threatening enough, the computer that  performs  the
copy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but
unbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac-
cessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.   (The relatively few
copying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten-
sively than machine guns are in the United States.)
 
     Now  the  ""conservative"" position is that we should not
sell these computers to the Soviets, because they could  use
them  in weapons systems.  The ""liberal"" position is that we
should sell them, in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and
cooperation--and  anyway,  if  we don't make the sale, there
will certainly be some other nation willing to.
 
     For my part, I'm ready to suggest that the  Libertarian
position should be to give them to the Soviets for free, and
if  necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn't
work load up an SR-71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over
Moscow in the middle of the night.  Paid for by private sub-
scription, of course, not taxation . . . I confess that this
is not a position that has gained much support among members
of  the conventional left-right political spectrum, but, af-
ter all, in the words of one of Illuminatus's characters, we
are political non-Euclideans:   The shortest distance  to  a
particular  goal may not look anything like what most people
would consider a ""straight line.""    Taking  a  long  enough
world-view,  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern-
ment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to
the enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution of
the Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen
missiles aimed at Moscow.
 
     But  there's  the rub:  A ""long enough"" world view does
suggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and  the
simply  stupid  will ""get what they deserve,"" but what's not
immediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being
killed, enslaved, or pauperized in the process.
 
    When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at-
tack freedom, they possessed a reasonably  stable,  healthy,
functioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed to
hamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  political
gradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now,  we  have
patchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wire
and spit.  The state not only taxes us to  ""feed  the  poor""
while also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive
up food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub-
sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in-
crease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witness
the fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as
potentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years
ago.  When the price went up,  we  were  told,  the  economy
risked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increase
was called the ""moral equivalent of war"" and the Feds  swung
into  action.    For the first time in American history, the
speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be-
came an issue of Federal concern.   Now, when the  price  of
oil  drops, again we risk problems, this time because Ameri-
can oil companies and Third World  basket-case  nations  who
sell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our
grossly over-extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  that
government  should now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC has
lowered, via a new oil tax.  Since the government is seeking
to raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did,
what  can we call this except the ""moral equivalent of civil
war--the government against its own people?""
 
     And, classically, in international trade, can you imag-
ine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to
court  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too
cheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be
compelled by the court to raise its prices, but also that it
be punished for the act of lowering them in the first place?
 
     So  while the statists could afford to take a couple of
hundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--we
certainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of
stability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  there
exists  almost  a  ""black  hole""  effect in the evolution of
nation-states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free-
dom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent,  the  state
warps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to
the degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomes
all but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seen
in the area of so-called ""welfare"" payments.  When those who
sup  at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) those
whose taxes must replenish the trough,  then  what  possible
choice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak-
ing  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many?  Go
down to the nearest ""welfare"" office, find just  two  people
on  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form
a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question
of who owns your life--and the fruits of your life's labor.
 
     So essentially those who love liberty need an ""edge"" of
some  sort  if  we're ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi-
ously  can't  use  the  altruists'  ""other-directedness""  of
""work,  slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation of
a billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world.""
Recognize  that, however immoral such an appeal might be, it
is nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today's culture.
If you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a
""cause,"" caring only enough for their personal welfare so as
to  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue
working--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy
to draw from.  Equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap-
peal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or
libertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonight
and say something like, ""Listen, follow me as I enunciate my
noble ""cause,"" contribute your money to support the ""cause,""
give  up  your  free  time  to  work for the ""cause,"" strive
selflessly to bring it about, and then (after you  and  your
children are dead) maybe your children's children will actu-
ally  live under egoism""--you'd all think I'd gone mad.  And
of course you'd be right.  Because the point I'm  trying  to
make is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if,
when, and as, individual libertarians and/or egoists find it
profitable and/or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  only
then.
 
     While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli-
tical  action, I don't believe that it is the only, nor even
necessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasing
freedom  in  our time.  Consider that, for a fraction of the
investment in time, money and effort I might expend in  try-
ing  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all
forms of censorship--I can teach every libertarian who's in-
terested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them
unilaterally.
 
     There  is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to
the Eskimoes, which very likely most Libertarians  have  al-
ready  heard.    And while you likely would not quarrel with
the saying, you might well feel that you've heard  it  often
enough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us,
and moreover, that maybe you're even tired of hearing it.  I
shall therefore repeat it now:
 
     If you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed him
for a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him
for a lifetime.
 
     Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of
a  ""workfare""  vs.  ""welfare""  context;  namely, that if you
genuinely wish to help someone in need, you should teach him
how to earn his sustenance, not simply how to  beg  for  it.
And of course this is true, if only because the next time he
is hungry, there might not be anybody around willing or even
able to give him a fish, whereas with the information on how
to fish, he is completely self sufficient.
 
     But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first order
content of the quote, and if there were nothing  further  to
glean  from  it,  I would have wasted your time by citing it
again.  After all, it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist
slant, as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac-
tivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry
beggars as we may encounter.
 
     But consider:
 
     Suppose this Eskimo doesn't know how to  fish,  but  he
does  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You, on the other hand,
have often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country
because  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things, and
they ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  suppose
the  two  of  you  decide to exchange information, bartering
fishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well,  the  first
thing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type
categorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premise
that  every  trade  must  have a ""winner"" and a ""loser;"" the
idea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the
""expense"" of another person who loses.  Clearly, under  this
scenario, such is not the case.  Each party has gained some-
thing  he  did  not have before, and neither has been dimin-
ished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information
(rather  than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sum
game.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The  ""law  of
diminishing   returns,""   the  ""first  and  second  laws  of
thermodynamics""--all those ""laws"" which constrain our possi-
bilities in other contexts--no longer bind us!   Now  that's
anarchy!
 
     Or  consider  another possibility:  Suppose this hungry
Eskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his
nation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fish
contain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, he
tells us, the state has decreed that their  consumption--and
even  their  possession--are  too  hazardous to the people's
health to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable,  willing
adults.   Perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thought
to be government property, and therefore it is the  function
of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern-
ment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener-
ously extends to competent adults the ""benefits"" it provides
to children and to the mentally ill:  namely,  a  full-time,
all-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need
not  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior
thought physically risky or morally ""naughty.""  But, in  any
case,  you  stare stupefied, while your Eskimo informant re-
lates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of
his was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of ""pos-
session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute.""
 
     Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely
oppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an
affront to the dignity of all human beings.  You may go far-
ther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion-
ary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting
this tyrant's goal.  (Your rationale may be ""altruistic""  in
the   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed,  or
""egoistic"" in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the
oppressor--or  very likely some combination of these or per-
haps even other motives.)
 
     But, since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to
your ""cause,"" you're not about to mount a military campaign,
or  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade.
However, it is here that technology--and in  particular  in-
formation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a
hundredfold.    I say ""literally,"" because for a fraction of
the effort (and virtually none of  the  risk)  attendant  to
smuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce a
hundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.  (If the tar-
geted government, like present-day America, at least permits
open  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re-
stricted,  then that should suffice.  But, if the government
attempts to suppress the flow of information as  well,  then
you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write
your  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to
your mythical Eskimo's public-key parameters.  But as far as
increasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuine
nonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as others
re-disseminate the information you have provided.   And  you
have not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id-
eological  adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde-
cided.  Recall Harry Browne's dictum  from  ""Freedom  in  an
Unfree World"" that the success of any endeavor is in general
inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua-
sion is necessary to its fulfilment.
 
     If  you  look  at  history, you cannot deny that it has
been dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington,
Lincoln,  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . .
Khadaffi . . .  and their ilk.  But it has also been  shaped
by  people with names like Edison, Curie, Marconi, Tesla and
Wozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per-
vasive, and not nearly so bloody.
 
     And  that's  where  I'm  trying  to  take The LiberTech
Project.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en-
slave, plunder or constrain us, I propose a libertarian net-
work spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize
freedom for ourselves.
 
     But here we must be a bit careful.  While it is not (at
present)  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government
wants to spy on you, there is no guarantee of what  the  fu-
ture  may hold.  There have been bills introduced, for exam-
ple, which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor
when government wants to shoot you.  That is, if you were to
commit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest, then that
fact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own.
This law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  but
it does indicate how government thinks.
 
     Other  technological  applications,  however, do indeed
pose legal risks.  We recognize, for  example,  that  anyone
who  helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the ""underground
railroad"" was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as
the sovereign government of the United States of America  at
that time found the buying and selling of human beings quite
as  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi-
larly, during Prohibition, anyone who used  his  bathtub  to
ferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug,
alcohol--the controlled substance, wine--was using  technol-
ogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents
for his ""crime""--unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life
when  Congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of this
drug.
 
     So . . . to quote a former President,  un-indicted  co-
conspirator  and pardoned felon . . . ""Let me make one thing
perfectly clear:""  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate,
participate  in, or conspire in the violation of any law--no
matter how oppressive,  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid
such  law may be.  It does engage in description (for educa-
tional and informational  purposes  only)  of  technological
processes,  and some of these processes (like flying a plane
or manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li-
censing to perform legally.    Fortunately,  no  license  is
needed  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it-
self.
 
     So, the next time you look at the political  scene  and
despair,  thinking,  ""Well,  if 51% of the nation and 51% of
this State, and 51% of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian
before  I'll  be  free,  then  somebody might as well cut my
goddamn throat now, and put me out of my  misery""--recognize
that  such  is not the case.  There exist ways to make your-
self free.
 
     If you wish to explore such techniques via the Project,
you are welcome to give me your name and address--or a  fake
name  and  mail  drop, for that matter--and you'll go on the
mailing list for my erratically-published newsletter.    Any
friends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interested
are welcome as well.  I'm not even asking for stamped  self-
addressed envelopes, since my printer can handle mailing la-
bels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared
with  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out.   If you
should have an idea to share, or even a  useful  product  to
plug,  I'll be glad to have you write it up for publication.
Even if you want to be the proverbial ""free rider"" and  just
benefit  from  what others contribute--you're still welcome:
Everything will be public domain; feel free to  copy  it  or
give it away (or sell it, for that matter, 'cause if you can
get  money  for  it while I'm taking full-page ads trying to
give it away, you're certainly entitled to  your  capitalist
profit . . .)  Anyway, every application of these principles
should make the world just a little freer, and I'm certainly
willing to underwrite that, at least for the forseeable  fu-
ture.
 
     I  will leave you with one final thought:  If you don't
learn how to beat your plowshares into  swords  before  they
outlaw  swords,  then you sure as HELL ought to learn before
they outlaw plowshares too.

New!  Just finished.  Fidonet support.  Dumb mailer support.  Incoming
header line pasting.

Here's what's going on.  There are a lot of mailers, the Fidonet
gateway in particular, which don't allow you to put arbitrary header
lines in your outgoing messages.  Previously people using these
systems couldn't use the remailer because they couldn't put the
necessary ""Request-Remailing-To:"" in the header.

Now they can.  Instead of putting header lines into actual header, I
now support a syntax which allows header lines to be _added_ to the
header on incoming mail.  These extended header lines are in the body
of the message proper, but a filter on incoming mail effectively
adds them to the header.  

This allows anybody who can send me mail with a reasonably unmangled
body to use any feature of the remailer that should ever get written.

Example:

------- cut here -------

To: hughes@soda.berkeley.edu
From: Secret_Squirrel@treehouse.com
Subject: Mrs. Tree's secret recipe for pinole

::
Request-Remailing-To: Crusader_Rabbit@rocky.moosylvania.org

I just paid $2600 for this recipe [etc. etc.]
[...]

------- cut here -------

If ""::"" is on the first body line all by itself, whatever lines follow
up to the first blank line will be appended to the header when it is
scanned for special instruction lines.

This new feature is completely modular.  It doesn't (seem to) break
any of the other existing features.  I'll post the source with an
explanation tomorrow.

In the meantime, try it out.

Eric

There's a new feature in the remailing software.

Some people can't add arbitrary header fields because of mailer or
gateway restrictions.  This restricts them from using the remailer.  I
have added a facility to allow new header fields to be pasted onto the
end of a header when the mail arrives.  This effectively happens
before processing by the remailer software.  These new fields exist
during transit in the message body, where they remain untouched.  Only
after the message is delivered to my account does this operator
take effect.

Syntax: If the first line of the body is the two characters ""::"", then
the following lines are appended to the header, up to the next blank
line.

Here's how it works.

First of all, here's my new .maildelivery file:

------- cut here -------
#
# field			pattern	action/	string 
#				result	(quote included spaces)
#
Request-Remailing-To	""""	pipe R	""perl remailer/remail.perl"" 
Request-Remailing-To	""""	file R	remailer/archive
*			""""	pipe R	""/usr/local/lib/mh/rcvtty -biff""
*			""""	pipe ?	""perl remailer/incoming.header.perl""
------- cut here -------

Comments are indicated by #.  The Request-Remailing-To lines have been
there.  The second of the makes an archive for debugging purposes.  It
will go eventually.  The third field, ""*"", indicates all fields, it
runs 'rcvtty' on my mail; this replaces the function of biff, since
mail is getting piped to slocal now, disabling biff.

The last line is the important one.  It says ""If the mail hasn't been
delivered by now, run the incoming header rewrite script on it.  If
that doesn't work, continue trying to deliver it.""

Now here's the trick.  slocal has no way of taking the output of the
rewrite and continuing to process it.  (It should.  It would make this
whole job easy.)  So in order to continue processing, you need to
redeliver the mail.  You could invoke sendmail and mail it back to
yourself, but that would mangle the existing header.  So the thing to
do is to recursively invoke slocal from within the perl script.

Here's the perl script to do all this:

------- cut here -------
  # First read in the whole header.
  # We check for the Second-Pass: line to detect infinite loops.

while (<>) {
	last if /^$/ ;
	exit 1 if /^Second-Pass:/ ;
	$header .= $_ ;
}

  # We have just read the last line in the header.
  # Now we check to see if there is a pasting operator.

if ( ( $_ = <> ) && /^::$/ ) {
	while (<>) {
		last if /^$/ ;
		$header .= $_ ;
	}
} else {
	# There is either an empty body or no pasting operator
	#   Thus exit with a return code of 1 to indicate that
	#   the mail has not been delivered.
		exit 1 ;
}

# There was a header pasting operator.
#   So we open 'slocal' as a pipe, effectively redelivering the mail
#   back to ourselves.

#open( OUTPUT, "">foo"" ) ;
open( OUTPUT, ""| /usr/local/lib/mh/slocal -user hughes"" ) ;
select( OUTPUT ) ;

# print a ""From "" line to satisfy slocal

@weekdays = ( ""Sun"",""Mon"",""Tue"",""Wed"",""Thu"",""Fri"", ""Sat"" ) ;

print $header ;
print ""Second-Pass:\n"" ;
print ""\n"" ; 
while (<>) {
} continue {
	print ;
}

------- cut here -------

Here's how the perl script works.

The first loop reads lines from the existing header.  When it sees a
blank line (regexp /^$/) it terminates the loop.  If it sees a field
""Second-Pass"", it knows it has filtered this message before and exits
with a return code indicating that the mail has not been delivered.
The variable $header is appended with the current header line.
$header contains the whole header when the loop terminates.

Properly speaking, the Second-Pass test is not necessary to detect
infinite loops.  Since the pasting operator gets removed during the
rewrite, the script won't return an exit status of 0 more times than
the pasting operator appears.  But should something get screwed up,
such as a different module adding pasting commands (how? I don't know),
the Second-Pass test should prevent infinite recursion.

The next statement reads another line from the input file.  This line
is the first line of the message body.  If this line is the pasting
operator, then header lines are accumulated in $header as before until
a blank line.  The difference is that these header lines are being
read from the body of the message.  If there is no pasting operator,
the script exits undelivered.

At this point we now have to redeliver the message back to ourselves.
We first open slocal as the output pipe.

The next section is a kludge.  It turns out that slocal strips off the
out-of-band ""From "" (no colon) line that the mail delivery system
uses.  In other words, the message which slocal pipes into its pipes
is not identical to the message it itself received.  This means that
slocal cannot be directly recursed.  What this section does is to
create a ""From "" line to make slocal happy.  It calls localtime() and
then formats those numbers into the proper form.

It turns out that slocal will deliver this mail without the ""From ""
line, even to /usr/spool/mail, but it doesn't do so properly.  On my
system, in added some delimiters which I think I've tracked down to
the 'mtstailor' file, namely mmdelivery1 and mmdelivery2.  Since these
are not null on my system, there's some garbage added which screws up
separation of the spool file into messages.  Adding a ""From "" line
fixes that.  This misbehavior may not be so surprising, considering
that slocal was ""meant"" to be invoked only in a .forward file.

Now we print the variable $header which contains the whole header,
including newlines.  Using a single string removes the need for an
array.  We added the Second-Pass line and a blank line for the end of
the header.  The final loop prints out the rest of the message body.

There is another way to proceed to get the same functionality.  One
could write a filter to translate the first occurrence only of
\n\n::\n into \n. We could then pass the message through this filter
before slocal saw it.  And for now, that would do the same thing.

But suppose we want more that one rewrite rule active?  Then you would
only be able to apply each rewrite rule exactly once in fixed order.
You want to be able to rewrite a message and then apply all the
rewrite rules again.  

At least one other rewrite rule is planned: automatic decryption.
Since decrypting a message will completely change the body, and since
some of the header fields may need to be hidden, you have to be able
to decrypt the body and then paste on header lines.  But since you
need to indicate an encrypted body by a header line (well, not really,
but it's more reliable), and since some people can't add these header
lines, you need to paste lines before encryption as well.

Thus the rewrite rules need to be applied asyncronously and hence I'm
using a fairly complex slocal scheme to do a simple filter.
Eventually I hope to write an equivalent to slocal which knows about
message rewrites and simple filters, but that's for later.

I look at it this way, by emailing my puplic key anyone can send me a secure 
message (I can't trust where/who it came from but we [the sender and I] can
assume that noone is eavesdroping (it could have been replaced but
not altered or read) 


For secure authenticated, where you *know* if came from me you have to contact
me or someone you trust that has contacted me.

======================================================================

Summary: Advances in the mathematics of prime factorization algorithms
         have led to a technology that, once standardized, will
         dramatically improve public-key cryptography. The RSA
         algorithm is popular in the computer industry, but the
         government favors an alternative.

======================================================================

ANYONE can sign a postcard, but how do you sign a piece of electronic
mail? Without a ""signature"" to demonstrate that, say, an electronic
transfer of funds really comes from someone authorised to make the
transfer, progress towards all-electronic commerce is stymied. Ways of
producing such signatures are available, thanks to the technology of
public-key cryptography. They will not work to everyone's best
advantage, though, until everyone uses the same public-key system. It
is an obvious opportunity for standards-makers - but in America they
have turned up their noses at all the variations on the theme
currently in use. The alternative standard for digital signatures now
offered by America's National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) has brought a long-simmering controversy back to the boil.

Public-key cryptography could become one of the most common
technologies of the information age, underpinning all sorts of routine
transactions. Not only does it promise to provide the digital
equivalent of a signature, it could also give users an electronic
envelope to keep private messages from prying eyes. The idea is to
create codes that have two related keys. In conventional cryptography
the sender and receiver share a single secret key; the sender uses it
to encode the message, the receiver to decode it. In public-key
techniques, each person has a pair of keys: a disclosed public key and
a secret private key. Messages encoded with the private key can only
be decoded with the corresponding public key, and vice versa. The
public keys are published like telephone numbers. The private keys are
secret.

With this technology, digital signatures are simple. Encode your
message, or just the name you sign it with, using your private key. If
the recipient can decode the message with your public key, he can be
confident it came from you. Sending a confidential message - putting
electronic mail in a tamper-proof envelope - is equally
straightforward. To send a secret to Alice encode it with her public
key. Only Alice (or someone else who knows her private key) will be
able to decode the message.

The heart of any system of public-key cryptography is a mathematical
function which takes in a message and a key, and puts out a code. This
function must be fairly quick and easy to use, so that putting things
into code does not take forever. It must be very hard to undo, so that
getting things out of code does take forever, unless the decoder has
the decoding key. Obviously, there must be no easy way to deduce the
private key from the public key.

Finding functions that meet these criteria is ""a combination of
mathematics and muddle"", according to Roger Needham of the Cambridge
Computer Laboratory. The greatest successes to arise from the muddle
so far are those using functions called prime factorisation
algorithms. They are based on the mathematical insight that, while it
is easy to multiply two numbers together, it is very hard to work
backwards to find the particular two numbers which were multiplied
together to produce some given number. If Alice chooses two large
prime numbers as her private key and publishes their 150-digit product
as her public key, it would probably take a code-breaker thousands of
years to work backwards to calculate her private keys. A variety of
schemes have been worked out which use this insight as the basis for a
workable public-key code.

Most popular of these is the so-called RSA algorithm, named after the
three MIT professors who created it - Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and
Len Adleman. It has been patented and is sold by a Silicon Valley
company, called RSA, that employs 15 people, most of them ex-MIT
graduate students. Faculty firms are to computer start-ups what family
firms were to the industrial revolution. RSA has attracted both
academic praise and a range of heavyweight commercial customers:
Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, Digital Equipment and Lotus Development.
But, despite repeated applications, it has never been endorsed by
those in government.

Rumours abound that the code-breakers in the National Security Agency
have discouraged standard-setters from recommending RSA because they
do not want to promote the use of codes they cannot break. RSA, for
obvious reasons, does not discourage the rumours. Whatever the reason,
the standard-setters at the NIST have side-stepped the debate over RSA
with their new algorithm, DSA. As set out in the standard, DSA
verifies the identity of the sender, but does not encrypt the message.
It appends to the message a number calculated from the message and the
sender's private key. The recipient can then use this number, the
message and the sender's public key to verify that the message is what
it seems.

The NIST says that this technique is well suited to ""smart cards"" and
other applications where there is not a lot of computing power
available for working out codes. Because it hopes that DSA Will be
used for verifying the identity of everyone from welfare recipients to
military contractors, its flexibility is a boon. Meanwhile, however,
more and more companies are choosing a public-key cryptography system
for communicating confidentially - often RSA, sometimes something
different. Someday, probably soon, governments will want to choose,
too. Watch out for fireworks when they do.

I've seen a number of postings so far about ""secure *and* authenticated""
requiring advance in-person distribution of key material.  This would seem
to eliminate the main advantage of public key systems, i.e. open
distribution of public keys.  So as long as we're handling key material in
person, how about one-time systems, eh?  Absolutely secure, provably so,
obsolescence-proof, simple & straightforward.  Not particularly exciting
from a theoretical point of view, but one-time systems are practical and on
the bottom line, they work.  What do y'all think...?

Someone asked for better directions, and the original ones were
pretty skimpy anyway.  Here's a better try.

	Cygnus Support
	1937 Landings Drive
	Mt. View, CA  94043

There's no phone service there yet.

Take US 101 toward Mt. View.  From San Francisco, it's about a
40-minute drive.  Get off at the Rengstorff Ave/Amphitheatre Parkway
exit.  If you were heading south on 101, you curve around to the
right, cross over the freeway, and get to a stoplight.  If you were
heading north on 101, you just come right off the exit to the
stoplight.  The light is the intersection of Amphitheatre and
Charleston Rd.  Take a right on Charleston; there's a right-turn-only
lane.

Follow Charleston for a short distance.  You'll pass the
Metaphor/Kaleida buildings on the right.  At a clump of palm trees and
a ""Landmark Deli"" sign, you can take a right into Landings Drive; this
gets you into the complex from the north.  Or you can go slightly
further along Charleston and take the next right, into a driveway with
a big ""Landmark"" sign in the middle.  No matter which way you got into
the complex, follow around it until you are on the side that faces the
freeway.  There's a clock tower that rises out of one of the
buildings, to the right (south) of the deli.  Enter through the doors
immediately under the clock tower.  They'll be open between noon and
1PM at least.  (See below if you're late.)

Once inside, take the stairs up, immediately to your right.  At the top
of the stairs, turn right past the treetops, and we'll be in 1937 on 
your left.

If you are late and the door under the clock tower is locked, you can
go to the deli (which will be around a building and left, as you face
the door), cut between the buildings to the right of the deli, and
into the back lawns between the complex and the farm behind it.  Walk
around the buildings until you see a satellite dish in the lawn.  Go
up the stairs next to the dish, which are the back stairs into the
Cygnus office space.  We'll prop the door (or you can bang on it if we
forget).

Or, you can find the guard who's wandering around the complex, who
knows there's a meeting happening and will let you in.  They can be
beeped at 965 5250, though you'll have trouble finding a phone.

Don't forget to eat first, or bring food at noon!  I recommend hitting
the burrito place on Rengstorff (La Costen~a) at about 11:45.  To get
there, when you get off 101, take Rengstorff (toward the hills) rather
than Amphitheatre (toward the bay).  Follow it about ten blocks until
the major intersection at Middlefield Road.  La Costen~a is the store
on your left at the corner.  You can turn left into the narrow lane
behind the store, which leads to a parking lot, and enter by the front
door, which faces the intersection.  To get to the meeting from there,
just retrace your route on Rengstorff, go straight over the freeway,
and turn right at the stoplight onto Charleston; see above.

See you there!

George recommends one-time pads.

The key distribution problem for one-time pads is *much* worse than
for public key systems, or even conventional secret key ciphers for
that matter.  You still have to exchange keys without transmission
(i.e. face to face meetings again, or mail, etc.).  Anything that is
secure for exchanging a one-time pad is also secure for exchanging
public keys.  Then you have to do this again when your pad runs out.
The bandwidth required for one-time keys is much higher than for
conventional keys to boot.

But the biggest advantage of public key systems is that I can sign
someone else's key, and if you know my key, then you know his.

To put it more humorously, you will have exchanged cryptographic
fluids with everyone I have as well.  This is a good thing.

Thank you for clarifying my particular problem: what I was worried
about was *authentication* not security. I had the two tangled up.
Duh. 

With an informal email/introducer setup for the FidoNet, we'll have a
fairly secure system with a reasonable level of authentification,
practically speaking, with authentification to some high level doable
on an individual basis. (Using PGP.)

This probably as ""good as it gets"" in our (email) environment.

Hi, I've just joined this list.

Interesting confusion about Mr. Squirrel.  That's one of the problems
with anonymity.  How do you know you're talking to the right person?

What you should do is to use a public key.  The pseudonym is not
really the name ""Secret Squirrel""; anybody can use that.  The pseudonym
is the public key.  Any message signed by that particular key is from
that particular squirrel.  Any message you encrypt in Squirrel's public
key is readable only by him.  If Squirrel changes his key, he should
sign the message so you know it's really _that_ squirrel who's changing
his key (and not some other squirrel telling people to use a new key).

A pseudonym is a public key.

Eric, good point about public keys and trust by association.  

More on OTPs.
You say the key distribution problem for OTPs is ""much worse"" than for PKS
and even other conventional ciphers.  ""Much worse"" in what ways?  The need
for F2F meetings with all possible correspondents is something which exists
with conventional ciphers.  The cost of key storage is trivial: a fraction
of the cost of the yearly (or less frequent) travel to meet each
correspondent in person.  Consider replaceable hard drive cartridges (30 meg
for about a buck a meg), digital cassette formats including applications
involving videocassettes, and so on.  Yes, as you say, you have to exchange
keys each time you run out of key; but you can keep ten years' with of key
(error: ""worth"" not ""with"") on hand if you like, taking up less physical
space than a box of cookies.  

""Bandwidth required is much higher...""  In what way?  Certainly not in terms
of transmission; a stream cipher is a stream cipher.  Perhaps in that each
plaintext character requires one key character?  This is just another
formulation of the ""storage"" issue: and again, if you have a stack of 30MB
cartridges, who cares?  Not like we're talking about punched paper tape.

I do agree that PKS offer convenience and features not available with
conventional ciphers.  However, RSA is just one mathematical breakthrough
away from being obsolete, and we have no way of knowing when that
breakthrough occurs.  It may also be that massively parallel processors can
be built through VLSI technology, allowing the cost of brute force solutions
to come down to a reasonable level.  

All of this is not by way of getting down on PKS.  I would suggest that we
need a number of different systems, and need to keep them all in fairly
constant use.  I think we're already all in agreement that one of those
systems should be RSA-based.  Now I'm just suggesting that a One-Time system
should be another one among the many.

BTW, sorry I couldn't make today's meeting; various local tasks demanding
attention; plus physical travel distance.   Be back next time...

Let me emphasize _each_ in that sentence.  One time pads are very
expensive on a per-link basis than public key systems for this reason
only.  Per-link is one person-to-person link.

   Consider replaceable hard drive cartridges (30 meg
   for about a buck a meg), digital cassette formats including applications
   involving videocassettes, and so on.  

Suppose one cartridge per link.  That's $30 per link.  Per link,
that's a _lot_ of money.

   ""Bandwidth required is much higher...""  In what way?  

Whatever channel you use to transmit keys on, be it 30 Mb cartridges
or what, will be more efficiently used by an exchange which requires
less storage.  In the case of cartridges, the UPS cost to ship one is
still only about 1/5 of the cost of a cartridge.  A 3 1/2 inch floppy
can be shipped for one or two ounces of postage.

   However, RSA is just one mathematical breakthrough
   away from being obsolete, and we have no way of knowing when that
   breakthrough occurs.

It is also one breakthrough away from being known to be fully secure.
Not only do we not know when that will happen, we don't know which
will happen.

   It may also be that massively parallel processors can
   be built through VLSI technology, allowing the cost of brute force solutions
   to come down to a reasonable level.  

Look at the figures for best know factoring algorithms.  Now estimate
the total amount of silicon output per annum in the US and estimate
it's computational ability.  I think you'll find that it would still
take on the order of years to factor a single 1024 bit modulus.

The difficulty of hard problems and the scale of the solar system are
two things which are both extremely difficult to get any intuition
about.

   I would suggest that we need a number of different systems, and
   need to keep them all in fairly constant use.  [...]  Now I'm just
   suggesting that a One-Time system should be another one among the
   many.

Here's the bottom line: More security, more cost.  Perfect security is
not worth the cost in time, effort, or dollars when the marginal cost
of perfection is less than the marginal benefit.

Even SWIFT, the international monetary wire transfer system, does not
use one time pads for link encryption.  Now here is a network which
breaking into would be worth billions (that's thousands of millions,
let me remind you).  The chief executives of SWIFT exchanges keys by
post.  

One time pads are useful for all sorts of things, but they are very
expensive to use.  They are useful in protocols for blinding and key
exchanges.  They do not seem to be useful for end-to-end link
encryption, however.

Bill Stewart (wcs@anchor.ho.att.com) writes, in part:
         
   [...Unlike the AX.25 link protocol specified by FCC rules, the higher
   level protocols are not required to be plain-text...]

Do you have a reference for this?  And does this apply to the contents,
the protocols, or both?  (E.g. can you use a crypto-based presentation
layer protocol and plain-text payload, or vice versa?)

----

The definitive reference is Part 97 of the FCC rules
(available from the US Government Printing Office,
Washington, D.C.  20402.  Phone orders: 202 783 3238.
Ask for ""Code of Federal Regulations"" 47 CFR 80 to End.)

To summarize the rules, except for certain remote control
operation as space or repeater machines, nothing can be 
transmitted with the intent that the meaning be obscured.

Conversely, text compression, for example, is legal because,
although the plaintext is certainly obscured, it wasn't the _intent_
of the LZ or Huffman or whatever coding to conceal the
meaning.

Likewise with UUencoding and a host of other compression/
error detection and correction schemes that incidentally
involutes the plaintext to some more efficient transmitted form.

Spread spectrum is treated somewhat more restrictively
since for that mode you may be required to produced the
logs and the content of the messages.  But not so for narrow-
band FM packet.

To sum up, using cryptography in general is prohibited.
(However, digital signatures are OK, even though based
on MD5 or SHA as long as the intent is not to _obscure the
meaning_ of part of the transmitted message.)

Clearly, though, the burden of proof is upon the FCC to show
that a particular message _was_ encrypted, since there
is _no_ theoretical, a priori way that an encrypted data
stream can be distinguished from one merely well compressed
or, just for that matter, random.

Of course you should verify this with an attorney if you are
troubled with fears of prosecution.

I just joined the list; I've read such archives as are locally
available, but I apologize if this subject has already come up.

Talking to a couple of people who had been to Saturday's meeting, I
was deeply disturbed by the choice of subject for the simulated
privacy game - trying to purchase illegal drugs. This is a subject on
which rational public discussion is essentially non-existent in this
country. Let me first state that I do favor the legalization of drugs,
and I am a committed libertarian (as I suspect are many of the people
in this group).

However, I think it is unwise to tie cryptography in with this issue.
Communications privacy is *too important* to take the risk that it
will get caught up in the current hysteria of the New Prohibition.
There have already been enough government attacks on cryptography that
we do not want to give them any more ammunition.

I think that if we are committed to getting cryptographic technology
in wide use, and spreading true privacy and information security
throughout the world, then we need to take careful account of the
political and social factors, as well as the technical. In order to be
successful, this needs to be not just a development project, but also
a marketing campaign.  When an MIS manager at some large corporation
is deciding whether to upgrade her network to privacy-enhanced mail,
we want her to associate it with security and liberty, not the street
corner punks who are trying to sell her kids crack.

In this vein, let me suggest some subjects for future simulations:

	- organizing the Boston Tea Party in the face of British spies
	and informers

	- purchasing condoms or Lady Chatterley's Lover back when they
	were banned (these bans seem so absurd now, that trying to get
	around them seems sensible and ordinary, and may start people
	thinking about the absurdity of current interdictions)

	- Yeltsin/Gorbachev vs the coup leaders

Furthermore, given the erosiion of constitutional protections in the
Drug War, I think the participants in Saturday's game were taking a
non-trivial risk to their persons and property. If the risk were
necessary to help spread cryptographic privacy, I think none would
begrudge it; however, I think it was not only unnecessary, but
counterproductive. 'Nuff said.

Excellent message.  I agree with your points about drugs.  I also like
the organization topics you suggest for the game.

On the victory conditions.  Right now, the game is declared over as
soon as any party accomplishes their objective.  This creates the
incentive to prevent other people from accomplishing their objective,
even if it would help me accomplish mine.  

The use of topics like the above gives clearer victory conditions:
One side or the other wins, even though that side only loosely
includes any particular participant in the game (an informer wins if
either his nominal side wins without his duplicity being revealed, or
if the opposition wins).

A plausible generic form of victory condition is for one 'side' to
succesfully transact some secure exchange, or for the other 'side' to
successfully break such a secure transaction.  I don't know how to
allow decoys with this model of victory.  Hmmm...

Re: drugs and simulation games.

At the meeting last Saturday, we played the second incarnation of the
remailing simulation game.  In a nutshell, the game is intended to
teach people about how to protect their privacy by using encryption to
prevent against monitoring and by using remailing to protect their
identities.  Since the game is also in part an economic simulation, I
tried to pick game objects which someone had some interest in keeping
quiet.  I picked drugs, of unspecified name, as a prominent game item.
This, by wide acclamation, is a mistake.  Since the primary reason to
pick this was a paucity of imagination, I now ask for help from the
list.

We want to develop a list of game items, physical objects, which will
be the goods of transaction.  I would like to pick objects that have
been illegal in the past, but which are not anymore.  They should not
be primarily information, such as copies of _Ulysses_.  They should
not now be restricted.  Nor should they be weapons, such as crossbows
or samurai swords.  They should, however, be objects that are known to
have generated some emotional reactions in the past.

There are two suggestions that meet these criteria: contraceptives and
printing presses (or xerox machines).  I would like to find more.
Please make your suggestions.

Another possibility is to use items which have been the subject of
state-enforced monopolies in the past, such as pepper or nutmeg.

Be creative.  We'd like to get a good list of twenty or so items.

Unfortunately the first two things which come to mind are:

coffee (a drug - actually an excuse for gathering)
papers on public key cryptography (primary information)

radios - illegel in Russia and I believe elsewhere during WWII
East German typewriters - I had one

Also a slight deviation: many medicines (and soon herbal contraptions) 
which are doctor monoply items here, but over the counter in most other
countries.

Religious artifacts of any number of banned religions.

Divorce (opps, not a physical object).

Really on thinking about it, I believe that the trade of ideas is always
far more repressed than the trade in any kind of stuff.

We definitely should have physical goods because the interface between
an information world (in which privacy and anonymity can be completely
protected) is where much of the complexity lies in managing things
like cryptographic money.

Good hard critique, Eric!  Now if I might try to salvage my position...

""One time pads are very (much more) expensive on a per-link basis than
public key systems...""  

Yes, of course.  However I don't envision OTPs as a standard for bulk
encryption on large networks.  Rather, for person-to-person communication in
small networks.  Examples: a group of civil rights attorneys suing the
Federal govt., an international environmental organisation's main offices in
the capital cities of a small number of countries, etc.  Cases where the
adversary is one or more powerful governments, and the number of links
required is relatively small.  Given the nature of the relationships between
these kinds of networks and their adversaries, the expense would seem to be
justified; in any case, the **incremental** cost of for instance a set of
30MB cartridges as compared to a few floppy discs, is an minor fraction of
the cost of the airline tickets and other expenses for trusted couriers.
(oops: ""a minor fraction..."")

Your discussion of bandwidth can be met with a similar counter-arguement.
First of all, I would reject the use of UPS or (God help us) the *Post
Office* as a courier, particularly where one or more governments may be the
adversaries against whom protection is needed.  
So your reference to those carriers is not relevant to the main point of my
case.  I'm assuming that key materials are transported by trusted courier
and are guarded by same until they reach their intended recipient.  Okay,
that *really* drives up the cost, doesn't it...?  Not if the key materials
""hitch hike"" on an existing travel plan: attorney A flies out to city B to
visit attorney B... and happens to carry key material onboard in his/her
shoulder bag.  No added cost except for the storage devices, and that is not
significant.  

Re mathematical breakthroughs in factoring etc, you say, ""we don't know when
that will happen, and we don't know which will happen.""  Exactly my point.
*We* don't know.  But the NSA and so on, most certainly do know, and they
won't be telling.  If the breakthrough comes, then the period between that
point and the point when it is publicised, will be one of false security.
Was it Kahn who said nothing is more dangerous than a bad cipher?  My point
here comes down to nothing more or less than the principle of caution in the
face of an unknown.  

(Discussion of relative cost of brute force solutions, and the question of
hard problems and scale.)  I agree that my intuition about these things may
be highly flawed. However this doesn't invalidate my point about the
possibility of basic breakthroughs happening behind closed doors.  Now in a
way I'll admit that my arguement here sort of comes down to a black box.
However, again I would assert that there are cases where the almost
irrational caution is worthwhile.  

You say in concluding, ""Perfect security is not worth the cost in time,
effort, or dollars when the marginal cost of perfection is less (do you mean
more?) than perfection.""  You cite examples of international banking
systems.

I would cite examples of political movements which have been sabotaged and
destroyed by government covert action.  One need not look far to run into
COINTELPRO and the more recent French govt action of blowing up a Greenpeace
vessel.  Where your adversaries are the intelligence agencies of world
powers, and where lives are at stake, I would say the cost of perfect
security is justified.  Now of course, the French terrorist bombing, the
destruction of Black nationalist and student organising groups in the US,
and other examples, may not (probably would not) have been prevented
altogether by adoption of perfect communications security.  Che Guevara
after all used OTPs, and it was radio direction finding and traffic analysis
(rather than cryptanalysis) which ultimately led to his murder by US-backed
mercenaries.  

If we are promoting a tendency which is inherently political, it implicitly
recognises governments as its adversaries.  Our choices of cryptographic
systems should reflect a wide range of applications and not exclude some
a-priori on grounds of cost or convenience.

The examples I always refer to are Federal civil rights suits naming the
Federal govt as defendant, and international ecological organisations
conducting whatever business they may be engaged on.  These may or may not
fulfill the game objectives, and they do tend to suffer from being a bit
mundane perhaps to the point of being unexciting.  However they are
historically relevant and probably will be so in the future.

Another possible topic would be womens' access to abortion, though given the
coming change in our govt this may be irrelevant.  

How about GIFs depicting sex between consenting adults?  Corporate
proprietary information on new technology, in an age of increasing
international competition (in this case the physical prototypes as well as
information about same).  International intrigues are always interesting:
small countries seek to combine economic power against large countries, that
kind of thing.

  Hal is somewhat right, anyone can use 'Secret Squirrel' and anyone
can use any public key they want also.  So, in a many-to-one scope (as
in a maillist) where the sender can not use the one-on-one signed
signiture method how do we have proff of who the sender really is?
  Maybe public forums are just not places where it is easy to verify
the identity of a speaker?

  A second thing that Hal's comments bring up is that we were reading
the From: headders and ignoreing the keys.  In good crypto-mail
readers the key ought to be checked against our own data base of
others keys and the result added to the hedders as say:
	KeyCheck: FooBar Bazoid holds this key in XXX database
or some such rot.  I wonder what is more important, who I claim to be
in a random message or what key I include...
  New keys ought for an ID (or new ID's for the same key) should be
added to the data base as well.
  But all this needs to be done automaticly by the mailers and
interfaces, else the system will be mis-used and folks will tire of
the extra work that gets them little advantage.

Previously I said about one-time pads: ""High security, high cost.""
(Well, not exactly that...)  I invoked it then in order to argue that
I personally didn't need to use one-time pads.  Implicit also in that
statement is the claim that when the worth of security is high, the
cost may be relatively cheap.  George and I agree on this point.

When you are fighting a military battle, when you have a government
pissed off at you in a serious way, you need as good as you can get.
Since you can get perfect end-to-end link encryption, you use it.

All cryptography is economics.  Repeat after me.  All cryptography is
economics.

I don't need one-time pads.  Sendero Luminoso does.  It's as easy as
that.  It's merely a matter of scale.  Large scale, high security.
Small scale, pretty good security.

Re: Mathematical breakthroughs.  George missed my main point here.  We
don't know whether factoring is ""fundamentally hard."" (Project your
own definition here.)  We should not assume that when the breakthrough
comes, that is will be found ""easy.""  It may be that factoring is
hard, and that RSA is secure for that reason.  (The astute reader will
see that these two are not exactly the same question.)  My current
thinking is that factoring is hard because of various randomness
properties of primes, that in fact multiplying one large prime by
another is like encrypting one prime with the other as a one-time pad!
But I'm no number theorist.

I do, however, agree with ""caution in the face of an unknown.""  And
for high stakes, George's ""irrational caution"" is not irrational at
all.

Re: Relative security.  It seems I had an editing error.  What I meant
to say (paraphrased) was the following.  Perfect security is not worth
the cost when the marginal cost of perfect security is more than the
marginal benefits of such security.  This encompasses both the high
end and the low end.  I don't need one-time pads.  Abu Nidal does.

Repeat after me.  Cryptography is all economics.

Hugh asks how, in a broadcast network, we may verify identity.  The
answer is ""statistically.""  Not everyone needs to verify each message;
only those who communicate with the sender personally (and who thus
know the private keys) need to.

Hugh mentions the ""one-on-one signed signature method"" and that it is
not applicable to broadcast.  Well, signing the whole message is not,
but signing a message digest is.  This is the whole reason for message
digests, that a message may go out in cleartext, but the validating
information for that message be encrypted.  Thus everyone can read the
message, even without knowledge of the public key, but it is possible
to verify the identity if you know it, i.e. you know the private key.

Hugh's comments brought up a idea to me.

RFC 822 is the standard for the format of Internet mail messages.
Anybody interested in the remailer should eventually read this thing.

In it there is already a standard header field ""Encrypted.""  It
accepts two optional arguments, a decryption type and an identifier
(say, for key lookup).  So we have a way of automatically telling
encrypted message without doing pattern recognition on the body.

I propose a couple more header fields.  ""Digest"" for signed message
digests.  ""Key-Mgmt"" for the distribution of new keys and key
compromise certificates, i.e. for automatic key distribution.

What else do we need to make a fairly automated crypto mail system?

The most pressing thing is not to integrate encryptions in mail handlers,
but at the level of ether.  Ether is an enormous security hole.  I can walk
up to anything running ether with my notebook, plug in, and listen to all
traffic.  Therefore, ether cards need public key encryption built in, so
they can communicate with eachother in a secure way.  This also applies to
all other low level protocols.

But, once person A creates public key X, nobody else can sign messages
using X.  So if all messages from A are signed under X, we can know
that they are all from the same person, even if they are sent anonymously
or under a pseudonym.

You can use signatures even in a many-to-one scope.  Messages from
a particular person could be signed and the signature appended to
the message.  Then anyone who has the public key can check to see
who the message came from.  The process is a little unwieldy now
in PGP because you have to separate the signature and message into
separate files and run PGP on the signature file.  This should be
streamlined.

Absolutely.  The most crying need now, IMO, is to better integrate the
cryptographic tools into mail readers and senders, so that it's not
such a pain to use these things.  People should be able to give a single
command or press a button to decrypt an incoming message or encrypt an
outgoing one.  Only then will these features be used by average people.

There was a message posted on alt.security.pgp describing how to
use PGP with the Emacs mail reading program.  I'd like to see more
messages telling how to use it with other systems.

Anyone can include your key in a random message. If you just sign your
messages, then the whole thing goes away and everyone knows its from
you. PGP allows you to sign messages without encrypting them. The
problem is that most people find using PGP on routine email
inconvenient.

A signature on a message is dependent on the contents of the message;
it is not a free floating bit of information.  You can't copy a
signature, therefore, without copying the message or find another
message that hashes to the same value.  This is the design criterion
behind one-way functions--that you can't (feasibly) find a message
that hashes to a given value.

I just completed (well, it's in ""beta"") a mail-reader package for
MSDOS and FidoNet. It does ""rm"" type stuff, and has PGP integrated
reawonably well. Single character commands to decrypt, encrypt, sign,
or encrypt/sign. It furnishes the distributed PGP.EXE program with
it's imput (deriving it from the message itself). It'll extract keys
from messages, and all that.

It's MSDOS and .MSG-type FidoNet message base oriented, but it does
all it's work in pure ASCII (FidoNet .MSG files are mixed binary and
text). It is intentionally ""RFC-822 like"", and will become fully
RFC-822 ""soon"".

I was reasonably careful regarding de-cyphered plaintext laying about
on disk, etc. It's available via Wazoo filerequest as magicname RM.
(That's probably as obscure to you as FTP is to FidoNet.)

It will be released as ""copyleft"" with all sources. Binaries only
this week til I get it shaken down.

     Who's to say that person B sees a message signed under X by person A.
He copies the signature (X) onto the bottom of one of his messages and
everyone thinks they can verify that it's from A but it's really from B.

One time pads don't provide perfect security, George.  They only
provide perfect security if the opponent doesn't know the contents of
the pad.  Given that most small organizations are in locations that are
easily burglarized, ``when lives are at stake'' it would be easy for
governments to break in, copy the storage medium containing the pad, and
then read all past and future traffic encrypted with that pad.

All cryptography is economics.  If you make it harder to tap your phone
lines, but it's cheap to break in, they'll do that.  There is no absolute
security this side of the grave (and who knows about the other side).

* Security and authentication using PGP in FidoNet

THOUGHTS ON SECURITY AND AUTHENTICATION
FOR EMAIL SYSTEMS
Tom Jennings (1:125/111)



Some ideas on public key security systems. To sum up ahead of time, I
assert that the public broadcasting of public keys is more than
enough security and authentication for casual, privacy needs in the
FidoNet or other email network.

All of this article assumes the use of PGP version 2.0, the RSA
double-key encryption system implemented as freeware.


This is all new to most of us, this security/privacy thing. Both
technologically and socially. What privacy we have we take for granted
without much thought; letters in envelopes, ""who is it?"" to knocks on
the door, etc. When we try to break down these things into their
underlying assumptions, well, it's hard. We shouldn't get upset with
ourselves or others if ""we don't get it"" right away. And we'll find
some obvious things aren't, and vice versa.

I will assume that if you really, really need utter absolute security,
you can achieve that with PGP or whatever. If it's that sensitive,
sending it over an electronic medium probably isn't recommended. This
article isn't about how to achieve bank-vault security.

Within the FidoNet, the most common use we all seem to talk about is
PRIVACY, rather than SECURITY. I can only speak for myself, but, my
netmail (not echomail) traffic is probably a reasonable example.  I
read about 100 messages a week, and send out about 50. There's a dozen
or so people I talk with regularly, and about 50 per week that I do
not know. Most of it is of the ""Oh yeah, so and so said this. How's
your mother. Did you get that file OK..."". Even if an eavesdropper
read this stuff, I would barely care. 

There are some times though when revealed message contents could be...
personally compromising. Embarrassing. A real life example: a long
time ago, a sysop in a net was having trouble with their net host.
Some messages critical of that net host were intercepted by the host,
some passed on, and some we each got replies to! Not Good. 

What *I* want is a way to ensure that sometimes, only the addressee
can read a given message. I am willing to pay some penalty for this,
but I won't live with a system that restrains me like a stone castle
and moat. My needs and risks just aren't that great.

With that as a background assumption, let's look at two separate
issues that look at first to be the same -- SECURITY and
AUTHENTICATION.


SECURITY -- given an encrypted message, how likely is it that someone
can ascertain what's inside it (assuming you're not the addressor or
addressee)?  As an operating assumption, I will take it for granted
that PGP produces files that are secure in themselves (barring bugs,
etc). Like the docs say, a frontal cryptological assault is hard, and
in our casual privacy case, probably not what we've got to worry
about.

There are other ways to figure out what's going on. Imagine you're
that net host. You've had trouble with this particular sysop before.
You notice he's just sent a flurry of messages to the local RC, then
the ZC. Hmmm!! Do you really need to know what's in those messages?!
(This is called traffic analysis. In pre-WWII Germany, the Nazis
tracked down ""Jew sympathizers"" with traffic analysis of telephone
billing information; Europeans don't get itemized phone bills any
longer... like here in the US. So I was told, the information is no
longer kept. (Do I really believe that...:-))

Anyways, security is more than cryptographic strength. Turns out,
there's a way around this: anonymous remailers. In a private Internet
mailing list Eric Hughes came up with a trick to anonymously remail
messages; you send mail destined for system X to the remailer instead;
it strips off the header info and mails it to system X.  Anonymity
isn't really needed though in the case above, simple remailing will
do. Again, our *general* FidoNet needs are modest.



AUTHENTICATION is the sticky one for us. Authentication is
determining: is this person really the person they say they are? But I
think you'll see it isn't the fatal problem it appears to be at first.

Let's get the obvious case out of the way first again: if you need
utter and absolute security, you better damn well know the person
ahead of time, you should get a key delivered by hand, and you should
think about if you really want to conduct business over an electronic
link in the first place. Authentication in this case isn't -- or
shouldn't be! -- a problem.

For our relatively-casual privacy use, authentication is almost moot.
Some people I have already exchanged keys with, *I've never met face
to face in my life* and may never. In spite of this I feel I know
them. I trust or assume that they are who they say they are. This is
the environment we need to work in.

This, plus the fact that we've got (at the moment) some 16,000
potential keys, means we simply can't do the full-blast security
thing. How much ""security"" can I expect, or need, with someone I've
never met? Consider again the utter-security case again.

But the bottom line is in fact already taken care of, PGP or not --
how do you know that ""the real Tom Jennings"" wrote this article? Our
underlying social system, so frequently overlooked, takes care of it.
You can assume I, and many people who have been in the net, are
verifiable. You have a number of ways to determine if I really wrote
this article. Simply asking via FidoNet will uncover most fakes.
Looking at old nodelists to see what info on my name has changed. Ask
people who might know me. And so on. 

If our public keys are scattered to the wind like plants scatter
pollen, it is certainly possible that I could fake ""your"" public key,
and gain access through all the methods discussed in detail in the
literature.  However, assuming the real person and the fake person(s)
are both generating keys (and using them to sign and send messages),
the more keyrings were passed around the chances of detecting the
incompatible keys becomes almost certain. At that point, even a casual
effort would be able to track it down, to at least determine that
there *was* a fake.

Example: Mary has been using PGP for a few months, and conversing with
friends and acquaintances. Her public key is filerequestable, and
probably appears on a hundred keyrings. 

Over the next few months, other people get messages from ""Mary"" making
increasingly odd claims, via encrypted mail. The impostors fake key,
in order to be useful at all, would also have to be widely
distributed.

Curious, someone sends Mary a message encrypted with what appears to
be her public key, and a plaintext one telling her that the
cyphertext was encrypted with her public key, and that he suggests if
she can't decipher it someone may have faked her key.

What Mary actually does depends on many things. If she has indeed
been creating the crazy messages, well, the problem's elsewhere. If
she finds she can't read the message, her recourse depends on what is
available to her: if there are public key repositories, she would be
advised to contact them and notify them of the alleged faked key(s),
and follow whatever process is setup to generate a new key.

The very knowledge of key collision would be enough to flag to users
that there's a potential problem.


There are more practical issues that limit our need for traditional
security measures on keys.

Even if you stored your private key on disk, it would take physical
access of your machine to get it. This is not what I'm worried about
in private FidoNet mail. If a FidoNet member tries to break into my
house or system to get at my key, I've got other troubles! 

Practically speaking, it might even be a good idea to have two keys; a
small (256 bit) one for casual, email privacy, and a big one (1024
bits) that you give to people by hand on diskette. The small key will
mean better performance, more important on bulk casual email, and
certainly adequate against eavesdropping. For high-security needs,
which most people don't have (I certainly  don't), the performance
penalty probably won't matter as much.

The worst part of security systems is that people will *rely* on them
as absolutes. This is the only thing that makes a faked, encrypted
message worse than a faked, plaintext message.

Again, it's important to remember the goal (as if we could ever
possibly agree to a *single* goal...) -- if it's privacy, the ability
to stop eavesdroppers, then a broadcast public key system is more than
adequate, and public key repositories even better. If you want a
maximum-security vault, you take added precautions. No one system will
solve all problems. I'm a firm believer in a broadcast public key
system for email.



PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR PGP USE IN FIDONET PRIVACY:

 * Use small (256 bit) keys for routine, low-security use, such as
netmail privacy with people you don't know personally (and don't get
keys from physically).

 * Public key encryption is most useful for email, ie. FidoNet
netmail, especially when it flows through multiple hosts on its way
to its destination.

 * The current password scheme for echomail links is proven to be
adequate to safeguard what is basically a public forum, anyways.
Further security doesn't seem to be needed on these links.

 * When adding keys received via FidoNet to your public keyring,
answer ""do you want to certify this key yourself"" with NO, unless you
received the key by hand. It doesn't hurt the usefulness of the key
itself; however, if someone later uses your public keyring they won't
be lulled into a false security. (Certification of keys can be done
at any time.)

 * Passing keyrings around willy-nilly, though counter to ""good
security practice"" in traditional uses is actually a good thing for
us. ""Key Repositories"" scattered throughout the net (each exchanging
keyrings as well as posting lists of ""trouble keys"") is a better idea.

 * Reserve large (1024 bit) keys for people who you know, and can
ensure security in traditional ways (some pointed out in the PGP
documentation). 

* As seems to be developing, have your public key filerequestable as
magicname ""PGPKEY"" (your own public key only), and your keyring as
""KEYRING"" (all of your public keys). These should be ASCII-armor
files (PGP -kxa)

Let me throw in another vote against the *necessity* of hierarchical
certification by arguing against the necessity of certification itself.

For example, it is possible, given digital signatures, to have totally
anonymous bank accounts -- identified only by public key -- with no
certification of relationship between that key and any other fact about any
individual or corporation.  Such accounts are at least as valuable as a
Swiss numbered account -- perhaps more so since no one need know the
identity of the person or people with the power to withdraw funds.  Such
funds transfers can be made not only anonymously but untraceably.  It might
even be possible for them to be made without it being possible to trace
the transfer at either end (eg., using digital cash techniques).

I don't propose that all bank accounts be anonymous.  It's just that I
don't like to see us jump into an attempt to relate public keys into the
physical world so that our old established notions about relationships and
responsibility can carry over into this new domain when by doing that we
end up avoiding research into all the possibilities which digital
signatures open up.  That research needs to be both technical and social --
or we could shy away from it by forcing relationships between keys and
those entities to which we are already accustomed.

PS:  I too think that other key certification models besides ""hierarchical""
are appropriate.  I think we can start from PEM software and PEM message
formats and evolve and experiment as appropriate.  Before you ask, currently
there is no PEM software widely available.  It's in alpha test.  It will
be released in full source code, and its development was funded by DARPA.

One might have a good reason to follow most of PEMs formatting
standards and the like; I'd fully agree its foolish in the extreme to
do otherwise. However, some of us don't like PEMs hierarchical key

I have been experimenting with Eric's remailing software on
the Sun 4 I use at work.  This is what I've found.

First, Eric's descriptions of how all the different software
components work together have been very helpful.  The software
has gone through three revisions as Eric added new features, so
I implemented them in that order - first the basic remailer,
then adding the ""##"" and ""::"" support for header management.

(I had to get perl and slocal before I could get started.
Luckily my system already uses sendmail.)

Basically, I was able to put the parts together the way Eric
described and have it work.  I was able to send messages and
have them remailed.  I even did some tests bouncing mail between
my remailer and Eric's.

Then I tried adding a new feature to the remailer - automatic
message decryption using PGP.  It's not really very secure since
anyone with root privileges at my site can see my pass phrase,
but my site is pretty isolated (a 2400 baud modem is the only link
to the outside world).  For this I had to add one line to Eric's
model .maildelivery file to invoke my PGP filter, and had to write
about a five line shell script to run PGP in a useful way.  I
am still tuning this a little bit but I can send the exact scripts
out when people are ready for them.

One nice thing about this is that, with my remailer plus Eric's,
and with the decryption option, you can now send anonymous messages
for which no one person can tell that you did it.  What you would
do is to send the message first through Eric's remailer, so I
don't know where it came from, then through my remailer, but with
the message encrypted so that Eric can't tell where it's going after
it leaves me.  If more people will run remailers then we'll have
much more security.

I will now tell you how to use it, in case you want to experiment.
But remember that all messages are going across an intermittently-
polled 2400 baud modem, so don't expect fast turnaround and please
don't send a large volume of messages.  Also, please don't pass
information about this remailer beyond this list, for now.

The remailer is at hal@ghs.com.  The basic remailing operation is
as Eric has described: either put ""Request-Remailing-To: <dest>"" in
the header of the message, or put, as the first two lines of the
body of your message:

::
Request-Remailing-To: <dest>

And follow these two lines with a blank line, then the message to
be forwarded.

Decryption is just a little complicated.  The thing to remember is
that you want to do more than just have me decrypt the message.  You
want me to then remail the message after decryption.  This means
that you should prepare a message with remailing instructions as
above, then encrypt the whole thing, including the ""::"" and
""Request-Remailing-To:"" lines.  Encrypt using PGP with the public
key I show below, and use the -a flag for Ascii output.

This will create a PGP output file, typically with the extension .asc.
The first line will be:

-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----

Now, you can send this message to me, but you have to do one more
thing.  You have to mark it as an encrypted message, by putting the
line ""Encrypted: PGP"" in the header.  If you can't put stuff into
the headers of messages, then use Eric's ""::"" feature and add the
following two lines, then a blank line, before ""-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----"":

::
Encrypted: PGP

Don't forget the blank line after these two.

Now, this message can be sent to my remailer.  It will be decrypted
and then remailed to whomever you requested.

I know this sounds complicated, so let me break it down into steps:

  1. Create the message.

  2. Add ""::"" and ""Request-Remailing-To: <dest>"" and a blank line to the
	top.

  3. Encrypt the whole file using PGP and the public key below.

  4. Add ""::"" and ""Encrypted: PGP"" and a blank line to the top of
  	the encrypted file.

  5. Send it to hal@ghs.com.

That's not so bad, is it?

Now, if you're really adventurous, here's how to do the double-remailing
process I described above, the one which keeps any one remailer from
knowing who's talking to whom.

  1. Create the message.

  2. Add ""::"" and ""Request-Remailing-To: <dest>"" and a blank line to the
	top.

  3. Encrypt the whole file using PGP and the public key below.

  4. Add ""::"" and ""Request-Remailing-To: hal@ghs.com"", then a blank line,
  	then ""##"" then ""Encrypted: PGP"", then a blank line, to the top of
  	the encrypted file.
  
  5. Send it to hughes@soda.berkeley.edu

The only complicated step is step 4, where you put in the remailing
request to go from Eric's system to mine, and use the ""##"" line so
that the outgoing message has ""Encrypted: PGP"" in the header.

If you want real security, encrypt the message using your friend's
public key after step 1 and send that.  Then nobody will even know
what you're saying, let alone who you're talking to.

As promised, here's the public key for my remailer:

  A genral and powerful method of makeing sure that Headders, Bodys
and Signatures match is to use cyrpto-checksums.

  For example in NetNews I proposed changing the MessageId: headder
such that part of the gobldyguk on the left side of the atsign was a
crypto hash of the body of the message and some of the important
sending host generated headders.
  With this system of MessageId:'s anyone who corrupts a message
(intentionaly or otherwise) creates a bogus message, as the next
machine that gets the message can see that the message does not match
it MessageId: line.

  So, if we design the signature system right (with a field for a
crypto hash, or some sort of secondarys signatures to in efect counter
sign various includes such as the plain text) a plain text message can
be signed in such a way that you can be sure that the text is the
right text and none other.
  This can be sent over the airwaves as it is not hideing information
but proveing that it is the right information!

  Systems like this would be *very* usefull right now, are simple to
do (with good advice from Crypto Math types) and usefull to everybody.

There's a FidoNet mailer (Dutchie) that uses MD4 to generate message

Some thoughts on the recent meetings and what we're doing:


1. The importance of trading physical goods in the Crypto Anarchy
Game.

This, in my view, has been given undue and misleading importance.
Physical goods are inherently easy to trace through remailers (via
sniffers, radioactive tracers, weight of packages, and many other
physical cues), are hard to store physically (imagine getting 100
parcels for later remailing), and, most importantly, have none of the
""envelope within envelope within...."" protection accorded to the bits
of a cryptographic remailing, or DC-Net, system! The elegance of
cryptographic protocols is lost with physical goods.

Furthermore, physical delivery of any good, whether drugs, stolen
missile components, antiquities and art items, whatever, is
fundamentally a hard problem to solve...smugglers and thieves have
been dealing this since the beginning of time. Stings can be easily
arranged, delivery is not anonymous (one merely watches who takes
delivery, or who opens a train station locker, etc....this is all SOP
for narcs and counterespionage types), and a raid on a remailing
entity will result in confiscation of the physical goods and (likely)
prosecution of those caught holding the stuff. (Raiding a bit
remailing entity produces only random-appearing bits...granted, the
authorities may well outlaw bit remailing, or use the RICO and
conspiracy/sedition laws to prosecute, but that's another topic.)

Our recent emphasis on physical goods, and all the ideas pouring in on
what other kinds of ""contraband"" besides drugs can be used, is
misleading. None of the richness of the cryptographic world is
faithfully preserved. I urge we get back to our roots and deal only
with things that can be expressed purely in bit form. 

2. The ""colonization of cyberspace"" does not mean there is no
interaction with the physical world, of course. But that interaction
can be mediated with money made by converting information or digital
money into physical money. Several methods for this conversion path
can be considered:

-Alice sells information in the cyberspace domain for the equivalent
of, say, $30,000. She converts this to ""real"" dollars by using an
escrow entity which hold both sides of the transaction until it's
completed. They then mail the information to the purchaser and send an
ordinary check ""for services rendered"" to Alice for $30K. She reports
it on her taxes, probably as a ""consulting fee"" (for which essentially
no government supervision currently exists, nor is likely to....), and
the conversion has taken place.  (Note: there are still elements of
trust involved, notably involving the escrow agent, but trust works
pretty well for many things, especially when reputations are at
stake. Understanding how real businesses depend on reputations is a
missing part of modern cryptology analyses of transactions...the
protocol analyzers and number theorists almost never take into account
how reputations work in the real world, But I digress.)

-Alice and Bob trade information such that Bob gets the information
worth about $30K, as above, and Alice gets another piece of
information she can use in the ""real world"" that is worth about $30K.
This might be stock tips, or, better, information she can turn around
and sell in the ""open market"" of a service like AMIX!  There are lots
of wrinkles, inefficiencies, etc., to be worked out.

-And then there is digital money. You all know about this, or should.
David Chaum, DigiCash, blinded notes, credentials, etc. The handout
for the first meeting had a glossary of terms. (IMHO, we should be
spending more of our time at our meeting discussing this, and less in
playing more interations of the Game.)

The fascinating novel ""Snow Crash,"" by Neil Stephenson, makes a
mistake in having Hiro Protagonist a very wealthy man in the Metaverse
(Stephenson's term for the virtual reality cyberspace) but a very poor
man in the Real World. Information _is_ money. Information is liquid,
flows across borders, and is generally convertible into real money.
(One simple conversion strategy, alluded to above, is for Alice to
sell her information for, say, $500K, and then to receive a
""consulting contract,"" perhaps called a ""retainer,"" of $50K a year for
the next 20 years. Her retainer is fully legal, is perhaps handled
through cut-outs who specialize in this kind of thing, and is a
low-risk way to ""launder"" money from cyberspace into the real world. I
have a lot more to say on these schemes, perhaps later.)

3. Are we emphasizing ""The Game"" too much?

If the goal is to produce a paper-based game, similar to ""Monopoly"" or
fantasy role-playing games, then I suppose more practice is needed.
But I'm not sure how worthwhile it is to try to design such a game.
(Those who wish to should do so, then commercialize it, and become the
Avalon Hill of crypto games!)

If the goal is educational, for newly interested folks, then I also
question how much more effort should be put into it. The ideas of
anonymous remailers, of digital money, etc., are, I think, gotten
across in the first 60 minutes of the game, especially if some of the
formalism is first explained (as it was at the first game, where
digital mixes, tamper-resistand modules for implementing mixes, the
""Dining Cryptographers Protocol,"" and digital money had all been
freshly covered, so participants were putting the theory to test).


I found the first game was instructive, the second much less so (and
_not_ because of the focus on drug selling...that was a relatively
minor issue). My impression is that many of the newcomers--and they
should jump in here with their own reactions (too bad we don't have
hypertext links!)--didn't really know how remailing mixes work, how
digital psueodnyms can protect privacy in transactions, and how the
""Game"" was intended to exercise these concepts.

4. We need to talk about the charter or purpose of the ""Cypherpunks""
or ""Cryptology Amateurs for Social Irresponsibility"" (CASI--Eric
Hughes's term) group.

-Is it mostly educational?
-Is it a lobbying group, as are EFF, CPSR, and the like?
-Is it to produce remailers, digital money, and other programming?
-Is it subversive?

Now clearly we can't say it's subversive (any bets on who's gatewaying
these messages to Other Listeners?). But we also don't want to skew
things toward ""YALG"" (Yet Another Lobbying Group), nor do we want to
be a spoon-feeding educational group for people with a casual (and
transient) interest in crypto stuff.

5. There have have been several messages so far about worries about
the legal implications of these topics, about how some
corporate-affiliated subscribers will desubscribe ""real fast"" if
certain discussion trends continue, and so on. Now we can't please
everybody, but maybe we ought to talk about this sensitive issue soon,
and _in person_.

Since it relates to our charter, Point 4 above, I recommend we do this
at our next meeting. I'd favor that over another iteration of the
Game.

In conclusion, we are in at the beginning of Something Big. While I'm
somewhat skeptical about the claims for things like nanotech, I see
this whole cyberspace/cryptology/digital money/transnationalism ball of
wax being _much_ easier to implement. Networks are multiplying beyond
any hope of government control, bandwidths are skyrocketing, CPUs are
putting awesome power on our desktops, PGP is generating incredible
interest, and social trends are making the time right for crypto
anarchy.

I look forward to hearing your views.

In the case of FidoNet, it sounds like that's what's needed, because your
mail is being sent from systems that are not multiuser systems.  The net
really is just for exchanging files and mail; it isn't for remote computer
access.

>You're totally right about it though... but it requires physical access.

Physical access is much easier than people think.  I can walk into almost
any computer room here at UC Berkeley and plug in.  And we have something
called building ether in the building I work in:  all of the machines in
this section of the building are on the same ether net.  This means that if
we want to see other researchers' data before it's published, we can,
because we can see all of their packets.

I'm trying to think in terms of things which were illegal but
which have good moral connotations today.

Crosses and other Christian symbols were supposedly outlawed
during the Roman empire (leading to the adoption of the fish
as a symbol of Christianity).  Posing as early Christians smuggling
crosses ought to make the right-wingers happy!

Abolitionists had to smuggle runaway slaves out of the South
on the so-called ""underground railroad"".  Perhaps cryptography
would have helped them coordinate their efforts.

Much of the support in the U.S. for freedom and privacy comes from
our revolutionary heritage.  I'm embarrassed at how little I can
recall of what things were restricted in those pre-revolutionary
days.  I recall the Stamp Act and a few other laws, and I imagine
that seditious materials were restricted.  Perhaps the game players
could be early revolutionaries trading items forbidden under British
rule.

     I have not been paying enough attention to the cyberpunk list,
but I did notice that some of you were concerned with the subject, and
that Tim May was mentioning ""pure information"" as a better model to
play with, so I thought I would send this in as a sample.  Perhaps
some ideas of where to take the story will come out of using this 
model for another game.  Anyway, this game theme should not push as 
many hot buttons as drugs do (though it should!). 

     This fragment of a tale was written shortly after I came back 
from the first Computers, Freedom and Privacy conference.  It is 
placed in the time period between now and the usual time frame of 
Gibsonian cyberpunk.  It was written to help me think about the social 
& legal responses we might see when encryption is more widely 
available-- and used.  Sorry the story is incomplete, I just got too 
busy to finish it, and ran short of ideas as well.  And sorry for the 
obsolete technology involved.  I am sure something better than MS DOS 
will come along eventually.  :-)

                Green Rage  by H. Keith Henson

     ""'Nother hour and I can 'crypt and email this mess.""  

     Lenny closed the forth of five files: maps, diagrams, schedules, 
assignments, and instructions.  It was a four person monkey wrench 
project for destroying a big piece of a paper mill and (he hoped) making 
it look like an accident.  It was due to take place on the east coast in 
a few weeks.  Lenny had never met any of the people who had scouted out 
the plant, nor the bitter, out-of-work engineer who had figured out how 
to wreck it, and none of the operators who were involved would meet each 
other.  Made for hard-to-crack operations.  Some people on the east coast 
did the same for the covert side of the GreenRage group that paid Lenny. 

     The tofu sandwich he had for breakfast was a dim memory.
 
     ""Lunch first."" Lenny thought.
 
     As he headed out to pick up a vegetarian pizza, he looked through 
the little glass panels in the front door. 
      
     ""Oh, shit, suits outside,""

     Lenny said it with feeling, but kept his voice down.  He turned on 
his heel in the hall leading to the front door and ran back into the 
grubby GreenRage office in the dining room of a rented house in San 
Samon.  He managed to hit the power switch on the PC at Stel's desk 
before the door opened.  Stel was in the bathroom.  Whether she heard the 
warning or not, Lenny could get no help from her, and Marge was out on 
errands.  The door was opening--there was no chance to get to the other 
two computers or to take down the '586 file server in the kitchen--he 
looked up and in his best bright and cheerful voice (which to Lenny 
sounded hollow and rehearsed) said, ""May I help you?"" 
    
      The first of the four suits, a beefy dude in a grey outfit spoke up. 

     ""Yes, you can.  We're from the CCA.  (The Computer Control Agency):  
We have a court order to copy all the computer files in this building,"" 
(he held up an official looking piece of paper--more trees destroyed, 
thought Lenny.) ""so unless you want to be charged with contempt, you can 
step back from that computer, and don't touch anything till we are done."" 

     Lenny stepped back.  He wasn't as terrified as he could have been, 
though his heart rate must have been close to 120 and his mouth was dry. 
He had been through raid drills and a few real confrontations with the 
law at pickets and bleed-ins. 

     ""At least it isn't a search warrant, we might keep operating"" he 
thought.  Then remembering the drill, spoke up: 

     ""Can I see the order?""  

     The beefy one handed it over while his three leaner and younger 
companions fanned out to the computers.  They obviously knew where the 
computers were, but that did not necessarily mean rot in the 
organization.  How well they coped with the 'puters would say something 
about that. 

     The paper was about what he expected, an order signed by a judge to 
copy every storage device in the GreenRage's office to an encrypted WORM 
drive.  The box for paper documents wasn't checked, so they knew they 
wouldn't find anything useful on paper.  Bad sign, it meant they knew 
more about GreenRage than Lenny liked.  ""Waste as much time as I can,"" 
Lenny thought to himself, and in a very polite voice he asked:

     ""Can I see some ID for you and your men? 

     The closest of the technoids, as Lenny thought of them looked up in 
disgust after putting his hand on the back of the ancient '386 clone 
Lenny had just killed.  

     ""Its been turned off in the last 2 minutes.  Did you do it when we 
came in?"" he said this looking right into Lenny's eyes, while digging out 
his badge. Lenny didn't lie with his reply, 

     ""Its Stel's, she was about to go out, and we try to save power by 
turning them off when we go out.""  He said this as loud as he dared, 
hoping that Stel would hear him in the bathroom, then spoke up even 
louder, 

     ""Stel, we have official visitors, so don't make any sudden moves."" 

     At 200+ pounds, and fifty plus years, Stel didn't make many fast 
moves, unless they were on young guys.  In view of the constant water 
shortage, the chances were only about one in four that she would flush 
the toilet, and less than even that Stel would wash her hands.  Without 
any running water sounds, she come out. 

     ""Pigs, huh.""  Stel had been politically imprinted as an anarchist at 
Madison over thirty years ago in the late '60s and early 70's.  When it 
suited her, she could be one of the most obnoxious people Lenny had ever 
known.  At least it diverted the attention from him, chances were low 
that the cops would grill Stel on who shut off the power on her computer. 

     Beefy, whose' badge claimed to be one Dan Barker, and technoid #1 
(Lenny never did get a name for him, flashed their badges. Lenny grabbed 
a whiteboard marker (almost dry, and the only non computer writing device 
permitted in the office) and scribbled Barker's name and badge number on 
the edge of a badly cluttered whiteboard.  The other two technoids had 
fanned out, one to Lenny's desk, and the other to the kitchen.  The 
kitchen one came back shaking his head. 

     ""No damn keyboard or display on the server.  Have to go in through 
the other ones to dump the disk."" 

     Technoid #2 moved the mouse on Marge's machine, but thank the green 
mother, thought Lenny, the screensaver program had timed out, and the ""I 
NEED A PASSWORD!"" message came up.  That meant the password was gone from 
memory on that machine.  Technoid #3 hit paydirt on Lenny's machine: the 
screen was still alive.  He hit the space bar, and pulled out a little 
alarm timer which he set to go off every 3 minutes. ""Damn, damnit"" 
thought Lenny, ""I should have set the timeout shorter, has it really been 
less than 5 minutes since I got up?""  And he was mentally kicking himself 
for not wiping the password when he got up. 

     Technoid #3 noted the directory (ACIDRAIN/TRMINATE) where Lenny had 
been working and went back up, a level at a time to the main directory on 
the file server.  He seemed prepared to deal with a no printer machine, 
pulling out a pad of paper from a little portfolio (more trees!) and 
started making notes on the directory structure. 

     Technoid #2 looked up from Marge's machine and asked Lenny, 

     ""I don't suppose you would know the password?"" 

     Lenny shook his head and then looked the agent in the eye.

     ""No sir! I certainly wouldn't know Marge's password to get into her 
personal machine!"" And wouldn't admit it if I did know, he thought. 

     Technoid #2 looked over at Stel frowning at the machine on her desk 
and asked mildly, 

    ""I don't suppose you would remember your password?"" 

    ""Fuck off sharp one,"" Stel said with a straight face.  Even in a near 
state of panic, Lenny got a flash of amusement as Beefy started to spit 
out a hot reply.  Beefy checked himself as he saw #2 write down 
fuckoff#1.  Stel grinned slightly; she had almost scored one on the 
agents. 

    Without making a move toward Stel's machine, #2 asked #3, 

    ""Shall I try it, Jim?""  Jim was engrossed, paging through directories 
but he mumbled: 

    ""No, let's see what I can get before we risk a password given under 
duress."" And, half a minute later, 

    ""This is going to be a bitch, I can't find any programs to dump 
memory, no debug, no basic, no smalltalk, no turbo, nothing.""  Lenny 
grinned, and straightened his face with an effort.  The crypt program had 
come with instructions to delete or encrypt under a special key a long 
list of compilers and interpreters-- not that he understood exactly what 
they were anyway. 

     ""Bob, could you have one of the uniformed officers get the camera 
out of the car?  Looks like we are going to have to photograph some of 
this.""  Beefy went to the door and tried to get the attention of one of 
the uniformed cops that had come with them.  No luck, they were both out 
back, keeping an eye on the building power switch so no one could turn it 
off.  It was less distance to the car, so he just walked out to the car, 
rummaged around in the back seat and brought back the camera kit.  Jim 
waited for him, typing a space every 3 minutes. 

     ""Take it easy on the polaroid, damn film costs two dollars a shot,"" 
as he handed the camera kit to technoid #3.  Technoid #2 came over to 
help and started clicking shots of the screen as Jim worked his way 
around in the directory tree.  There were *lots* of interesting directory 
and file names.  Stel, Marge, and the three masked visitors from back 
east had spent a whole evening making up provocative names like HIT_LIST 
(Lenny's address book), and $LAUNDRY (data for a spreadsheet program 
Marge used), and a lot of disaster names like HINDENBG, and TEX_CITY.  
Since the crypt program left the directories in the clear, they thought 
they might as well make them amusing.  At the moment, with cold sweat 
dripping down his back, Lenny wished he had made the directories a little 
*less* provocative. 

     Once in a while, technoid #3 or Jim as Lenny was beginning to use to 
identify him--gotta scribble that name on the white board--would give the 
command to type out a file to the screen.  He either got a mess of 
published material from decade-old anarchist newsletters, some of which 
they carefully photographed on the screen, or computer-generated random 
bytes (which, of course, they thought was encrypted material).  One or 
the other of the technoids not sitting at the screen kept themselves 
shielding the power switch and plug.  Stel was sitting on the grubby 
couch waiting for the technoids to either break into the system or screw 
up.  Lenny went over and joined her, feeling miserable about the agents 
getting in through _his_ system and unwilling to watch any more and give 
away by body language when they were about to trip.  He glanced at his 
watch.  The damn cron program should ask for the password in another 20 
minutes.  ""Jeez,"" he thought, ""I hope they don't get anything.""  

     ""There are _10_ copies of something which looks like a word processor 
on the server hard drive--they all have the same byte count and date, and 
there is _NO_ 'path' set,"" technoid #3 bitched loudly enough for Lenny to 
hear.  (Happened that this was an accident.   Lenny had found that if he 
copied the word processor into each directory he made, it worked fine.)  
The server had an old 700 Mbyte drive, and a few copies more or less of a half 
Meg program made no big difference.  However at the moment, the technoids 
had concluded that this was a clever hack, that the system would wipe the 
password out of memory if they tried to run the wrong word processor 
program.  They outfoxed themselves: any one of them would have worked 
fine.  (""Type"" or ""copy"" to the screen wouldn't work because the WD*11.0 
stored files in compressed binary.) 

     ""Well, Bob, it is moment of truth time.  We can take a 1 in 10 
chance of starting up the word processor and looking at the files, or we 
can try to load in a program to extract the key from this thing's 
stinking memory.  What say?"" 

     ""You guys are the experts, don't ask me."" 

     After a short conference, technoid #3 fished a diskette out of his 
pocket, kissed it for luck, and stuck it in the drive on Lenny's machine. 

    ""Here goes nothing."" and he typed ""dir a:"".  The crypt program was 
watching for diskette access, and came back with: 

                  ""I NEED A PASSWORD! 

     ""Shit.""  whispered a dejected technoid under his breath.  ""Know 
anybody at NSA?"" 

---------------- 
   
     Lenny put the back of his palmtop on the microphone of a payphone 
and hit the dial button. 

     ""That will be one dollar for the first minute."" 

     Bong, bong, bong, bong. 

     ""Thank you for using ESJI, you have one minute.""  Buzz-click, 

     ""Hello, there is no one here at the moment, but you can record a 
message.""

     ""Here"" was a little module of code in an automated PBX/voice mail 
machine watching for incoming calls after working hours on a line deep in 
the list of numbers assigned to a small corporation.  It was an old 
machine, and unlikely to get another software upgrade.  After taking a 
call, it would not take another for several hours, and it rotated through 
several recorded messages.

     Lenny hit the next button down on the palmtop.

     #-Beep, 4-Beep, 3-Beep, 6-Beep.

     ""confirm with password.
  
     L-beep, E-beep, N-beep.

     ""Record message.  End with any key.""
 
     Beeeeep. 

     ""Nancy, its Murray, just called to say hi.  Get back to me sometime 
when you get a chance.""  #-beep. 

    ""Message confirmation number 36, repeat 36,"" and a click.
         
     The PBX made a local call to a paging company and transmitted what 
looked like a phone number.  The phone number digits added up to 36.

     Lenny punched 36 into his palmtop and hit the enter key.  It came up 
with an address, a description, and a phone number.  It was the phone  
next to the K-mart entrance about a mile away. 

    ""K-mart will be closing about the time I get over there,"" he thought. 
""Could have taken the bike.""  He closed the palmtop.  It sensed the 
closing and erased its encryption password. 

     Lenny got back in his tiny 5 year old ""B-car,"" the 60 mpg car some 
rich dude had been force to take in a package deal when he bought a 20 
mpg Lincoln Towncar.  He twisted the key.  The lights dimmed as the 
catalytic convertor came back up to heat on the battery.  There was a few 
seconds' wait to let the battery recover, and the car started.  Lenny 
watched for cops as he drove over to the K-mart, but he didn't drive 
*too* cautiously.  That was one sure way to attract attention.  There 
wasn't much of a mob leaving the closing K-mart on a weekday.  Lenny 
parked near the phones and walked over.  He was about 20 feet away when 
the one on the left rang.  He picked it up and said, 

     ""36.""

     ""What's the problem?  If you forgot your key, I can't help."" 

     The voice on the other end sounded odd.  It was probably going 
through some blind location in Mexico where the automatic number 
identification had not yet been installed.  It also had the quality of 
digital speech.  Original words of the speaker were being converted to 
phonemes and back to words.  Not a hint of the speaker's real voice 
quality came through, though this dodge did not affect word choice and 
rhythm patterns. 

     ""Agents,"" Lenny said.  The CCAs came in early this afternoon.  I 
don't think they got anything, but I needed someone to talk to."" 

     ""Dumb idea if they are watching you, but tell me what happened 
anyway."" 

     Lenny related the events of the afternoon up to the point where the 
agents lost the password on his machine by trying to load a memory dump 
program from a diskette.  And then he went on. 

     ""After that, they popped the cover off the server, hooked up their 
gear and copied the 700 Meg disk, a few dozen 60Mbyte SMs, and a few 
dozen 3 meg floppies.  One of them had your crypt package.  They didn't 
mention my palmtop, and Marge keeps the backup tapes at home.  Only 
took them about 2 hours. They put the covers back on and left me with 
what they called a PK encrypted 2.4 Gig WORM cartridge.  They took one 
just like it, and even made me choose which one I got.  The order said I 
was required to take one of them.  It has all kinds of legal seals and 
signatures on it.  They said take it to our lawyer.  One of us took it 
over about 5 pm.  None of us have a way to read it.  Are we in trouble?""  

     There was quite a delay.  Then, the digital voice spoke up. 

     ""Even if they were able to track me down, *I* am not in trouble. I 
make a point of posting all the programs I ever give out.  In source code 
yet."" 

     ""I don't think you are in trouble from what they took with them.  
The copy they left with you is the data off your disk, encrypted with a 
half-key the judge issued.  Until the hearing they can't read it because 
they lack the other half of the key. The only use for it is to keep them 
from making a copy of data, changing the data and making another one of 
those write-once cartridges.  So, you are ok till the hearing.""  

     There was more delay, then the funny sounding voice on the other end 
of the line went on. 

     ""Presuming the passwords are not compromised, even getting the other 
half of the key from the judge to look at what they took should not be a 
big problem.  But since they came in at all, I would say you are in big 
time trouble.  That was a piece of dumb luck that they didn't try WD* on 
your files.  Of course they always have the option to give you blanket 
immunity and force the key out of you, but by the time they get around to 
doing that, you can forget the key.  I sure would.  I presume you had the 
machine convert all the files after they came in to a new password?"" 

     ""Not yet.  I haven't let anyone put a password into any of the 
machines since they showed up.  I'm afraid they will have a camera bug 
looking over my shoulder.  About a month ago, I read in the paper that 
they did that to a bookie in St Paul."" 

     ""Not likely for you--but possible.  Hmmm, did they leave any 
judicial orders about not moving the machines?"" 

     ""Not from what I read on the court order.  I can ask our lawyer.  
Our lawyer may be good at filing objections to logging company projects, 
but I think he is out of his depth if they go after us criminally.  I 
can't afford a criminal lawyer.  I called around and the best deal I 
could get was $100k retainer, cash or gold, no checks."" 

    ""They have already gone after you criminally.  You don't get a data 
search order from a judge without a fairly good reason.  On the other 
hand, it was not a search warrant.  It is arguable that they shouldn't 
have gone looking at stuff in your files, but who needs to argue?  They 
either don't have enough on you for that or they are waiting to see what 
you do and who you talk to after the DSO.  I don't know and don't want to 
know what you are doing, but there must have been something that tipped 
them off."" 

     ""I can't think of anything--even if the people we are sending email 
to on the east coast had all been turned, I can't see how they could have 
traced it back to us.  Mail to them was going through about 10 blind 
links, sometimes took 3-4 days to get cross country, it was deep 'crypted 
all the way, and somebody donated the digital stamps."" 

     ""Never like to use digital stamps I haven't bought myself with cash, 
and then only from a reputable Swiss bank.  But I can't see how that 
would have done any harm . . . . is there any chance the stamps might 
have been 'used?'  That would certainly compromise your traffic, though 
not the messages."" 

     ""Nope, a few of the messages circulate back to us.  They wouldn't if 
the ""stamps"" were no good.""  

     ""Not necessarily true.  The mom and pop forwarders often accumulate 
stamps for a week or more before sending them to the bank.  You just 
can't check with a bank on dollar or sub-dollar amounts--connect time 
eats you up. 

     ""The first link was Telesis, and I know they are on line to the bank 
that issued the stamps . . . .  Unless they are . . . . in on it. . . ."" 
Lenny was looking right at the Telesis logo on the phone. 

     ""Yeah, '/Paranoia strikes deep/' . . . .  Did the court order say 
anything about why they were going after you?"" 

     ""No, there was a note on the order that the supporting affidavits 
were sealed."" 

     ""You guys rate!  There hasn't been a sealed affidavit for a DSO I 
know about in the last ten years.  The stink around the Steve Jackson 
warrant took years to wear off!  Well, they have to unseal them before 
the hearing.  The hearing has to be within the next three weeks if I 
remember right."" 

     ""You do, it's on the 9th of next month, 20 days from now."" 

     ""Well, the first thing you should do is change the password, so you 
can start forgetting the old one.  How much clear stuff was on the disk? 

     ""None that I know about . . . . well actually about half the disk 
was filled with the nastiest old published stuff we could find--rabid 
libertarian literature and anarchist newsletters, public domain stuff off 
a CD ROM. The rest was filled with random numbers from a noise card when 
your guy set it up last year, then we deleted about half of it to give us 
working space.  But far as I know, there was nothing to worry about in 
the clear.  Snooper hasn't been complaining about unencrypted files when 
I run it on startup every morning."" 

     ""There is a hole in that program, but it takes some very special 
circumstances for it to fail.  I kind of doubt you are being watched.  If 
they were going to go to that much trouble, a search warrant instead of a 
digital search order would have been the way to go, but if you are really 
worried about them looking over your shoulder, take your machine and the

   ------------- 

     Lenny and Marge checked into a motel which had definitely seen 
better times, but was happy to take cash.  A lot of people had quit using 
credit cards, especially for checking into a motel on the hourly plan.  
It was just too easy for people to tap into credit card records.  The 
swimming pool was dry in July, but what the heck, they weren't here for 
swimming. 

     ""I can't believe this, Marge, this power outlet has only _two_ 
holes."" 

     ""Lenny, this place was built before they invented grounding plugs, 
what do you expect."" 

     ""Well, what the heck are we going to do now?"" 

     ""First we look around.  No problem, the socket in the bathroom is a 
3 pronger."" 

     Lenny plugged in the powerstrip while Marge plugged the pieces of 
the PCs together and connected a short network cable between them.  Lenny 
joked to keep down his nervousness; 

     ""Wonder what they thought of us.""  Not many couples bring in couple 
of PCs to do perverted things in the dark."" 

     ""Lenny!"" Marge said sharply. 

     ""No, Marge, I meant the _PCs_ will be doing things in the dark, not 
us.""  Marge picked up on the joke by looking disappointed. She really 
wasn't.  Lenny was one of those rare guys who just did not care about sex 
with anybody.  Her regular boyfriends knew she was not getting any at 
work. 

-------------- 

     The 'crypt program rejected the first three passwords Lenny tried as 
too simple.  Which to him meant easy to remember.  He finally got it to 
accept anhtre spelled a@n7t%h7e$r (the password program would drop the 
final r).  Lenny's first password had been sesame.  He had used 
variations on opendoor, opendore, openwindow, enterhere, portculius, 
drawbridge, safedoor, gateway at various times.  If anybody had a list of 
his passwords, they would be a long way up on selecting attacks.  He felt 
he was doing the best he could to make them complex, but still 
rememberable.  He left the duress password (bugout) alone.  It was one he 
had kept using for years, and never had needed.  Lenny wasn't certain he 
would use it if he got a chance.  Even though Marge backed up the disk 
every week, he would lose a lot of work if he used the duress password 
and wiped the disk. 

----------- 
   
     They crammed the computers back into the tiny car five hours later.   
Marge dropped the key in the slot by the office and they drove back to 
the GreenRage office where Marge and Lenny set up the machines and Marge 
started the backup program.  The CCA observer made voice and printed 
notes of their return on his palmtop from the stakeout location inside a 
furniture company office about a block down the street. 

--------- 

     The office never got up to full productivity over the next five 
weeks, but Lenny did finish and email the project--with notes to the 
effect that the enclosed was chapters from a book he was writing, and a 
true-to-life description of the data search order being carried out.  He 
left it up to the folks on the other end.  If they wanted to carry out a 
project which was in the hands of the cops, it was on their heads. 

---------- 

     The DSO hearing went about as expected.  The judge granted a two 
week extension over the protest of Bruce, the GreenRage's lawyer.  When 
the day came, Lenny, Marge, Stel, and Bruce were all looking more 
respectable than they usually did.  Even Stel was wearing a dress (long 
out of style, but the only decent one she owned).  

     The hearing at the federal building started in open court with a 
request from the US Attorney for the judge to review the CCS's material 
in camera.  

     ""Mr. Mulronny, I have already looked over the affidavits you sent 
over, and I can't do it.  I already granted you an extra two weeks, and 
the law can only be stretched so far.  You either have to make a case and 
let these people defend their data, or you have to drop it."" 

     Mulronny looked unhappy, but was prepared with the unsealed 
affidavits.  He gave one to Lenny, one to Bruce, and one to the judge.  
The judge looked at Bruce, 

     ""Your honor, this is only about 11 pages, I think my client and I 
can review it during a short recess, or you could take up other actions 
while we review this."" 

     Court matters were running a little ahead of schedule that morning, 
so the judge had the clerk pencil them in after the next two short 
actions.  They went out in the hall, not worrying about snoops except 
being overheard.  The last time a judge found out that someone was 
bugging the courthouse, the head of the agency that did it spent time in 
the drunk tank for contempt. 

     Lenny had read the affidavit almost through when they reached the 
far end of the hall.  Bruce waited till he finished, and said,  

     ""Well?"" 

     Lenny shook his head, 

     ""They're after someone else.  I've read about some of the events 
they are citing, but I sure don't know anything about them."" 
  
     That wasn`t entirely true.  One of the ""events"" was one Lenny had 
put together, but when it didn't come off within a year, he had decided 
they had chickened out.  Since the project he had put together took out 
much of an oil refinery, he was not surprised.  Industrial sabotage on 
that scale took more than a little guts.  When the plant finally blew up, 
Lenny watched the papers for weeks, but never found out if it was ruled 
accidental.  The feds did not seem to be sure either, they only mentioned 
it as a possibility.  The other accusations were split between cases 
where Lenny strongly suspected sister organization had done the deed, or 
industrial accidents where some organization had taken credit for what 
was probably an accident. 

     Back in court Bruce complained to the judge that there was nothing 
substantial in the affidavit supporting the DSO, and that while his 
client did not have anything to hide, the government was asking to break 
into the confidential business records of a public interest group.  And 
if they would not just forget the whole thing, he wanted more time to 
respond.

     The US Attorney would have asked for more time to respond if Bruce 
had not, so he was agreeable.  The clerk set a date for 6 weeks off.
                                                  
--------

     Lenny was paralyzed from the neck down.  The judge was asking him 
for the password, and he could not remember it.  The bailiff, clerk, 
Bruce and Mulroony were all talking in a huddle and he could not make 
sense out of anything they said, no matter how hard he tried.  

    ""This will do it!"" one of them said, and jammed a furry dead fish 
under his nose. 

    Lenny found he could move as he pushed it away.  He woke up to find 
the cat had been licking his face and smelling of fish flavored cat food. 
                                
    5:14 AM.  ""There isn't much point in trying to get back to sleep,"" he 
thought but Lenny flopped back on the bed.  The cat started to purr and 
kneed the covers.  Lenny absently rubbed its head, and thought about the 
next fundraising letter.  The DSO had had the effect of galvanizing the 
GreenRage membership, so donations were way up, and for the first time in 
several years, there was more than just a little money in the bank 
account of GreenRage.  Of course, it was flowing out almost as fast.  
Even though Bruce charged about half the going lawyer rate to public 
interest organiztions, fighting the DSO was going to cost them a bundle.  
""Just how much of the stuff on the disk is going to cause trouble,""  
Lenny realized he had spoken outloud.  If they asked for a special 
master, the membership list could be declared off limits.  Unlike the old 
days, when the cops could look through outgoing mail at the post office, 
an electronic mail list was fairly secure.  

     There wasn't much of interest in the finantial records either.  Oh, 
a few thousands spent for sabatage material would be hard to account for 
if they really dug into it, but the bulk of the money was spent on 
saleries, office supplies, rent, and telecom charges.  They could always 
claim the money was spent on spray cans and ceramic spikes for trees.  
And we can say we spent it for dope.  Lenny grinned at this one.  He had 
given up smoking dope, made him too paranoid.  But, every fall some 
unknown but appreciated benifactor sent the office a plastic tub of the 
stickyest buds you could imagine. Perhaps one of their above ground 
efforts had saved some trees screening the ""crop.""   Marge and Stel had 
split the tub the last two years. 

   The problem was not the lastest project.  Nor was it the one or two a 
month Lenny had put together over the last 3 years.  They were long 
perged, and the disk space overwritten.  And he didn't worry about the 
contents of the newletters.  Presumably *somebody* on the list was a 
ringer, and the cops had a collection of *The GreenFlag.*  What woke 
Lenny up in the middle of the night (besides his cat) was the stuff which 
they had on that WORM disk which *had not yet happened*.  He could 
probably get away with claiming that the files on the events which had 
happened were interactive fiction based on news stories.  Or could he?  
Nope, the damn files are dated prior to the ""events,"" he thought.  And, 
even though fewer than half of the projects he had worked on ever came 
off, there were at least three or four of them they could nail me on.  

   Lenny turned the light on and pulled his palmtop out of the charging 
stand next to the bed.  He stretched the keyboard out to full size and 
set there trying to put his thoughts in order.  After entering his 
password, he brought up an organizer program.  It prompted:  State the 
problem. 

    ""I don't want to go to jail for conspiricy.  The only way to stay out 
of jail is to keep the cops from looking through the GreenRage computer 
files.  Or is it?   If they can't convence the judge that they need to 
look through the files, then no problem.  If they can, then they come 
asking me for the password.  Assuming they can't crack the encryption-- 
which seems likely.  If I give it, I go to jail, if I don't, I may get 
jailed for contempt, unless they give me blanket immunity.  In either 
case, my days of managing monkey wrench projects are over."" 

    The organizer program came up with: 

    You have used one or more legal terms.  We recommend you submit your 
completed outline to a lawyer. 

    It then proceeded to break the statements into an if-then-else logic 
tree which did not help Lenny much either.

Screw this fake scenario shit, here's some real ones:

-- Safe sex in the age of AIDS. Guess what -- oral sex is safe. Cum in
your mouth and stomach does not transmit HIV. *No one* is tracking
healthy people. There were *two* ""documented"" cases (none of the above
type) that seemed to be oral transmission of AIDS. Saying ""oral sex is
generally safe"" would amount to condoning oral sex. Fat chance in the
US.

-- HIV is not always involved in AIDS.

-- Not all people with AIDS die on schedule like the CDC says. AZT
kills people. Many people live years and years. Some few haven't died
since the ""discovery"" of AIDS in 85/86. No one is studying them
either.

-- Access to genuine information on RU-48 (?) the so-called abortion
pill. Turns out it does some cool stuff re: breast cancer and even
morning-after abortion.

-- Access to sexuality information of all or any kinds. Not all people
do the ole missionary position. Erotica of all kinds.


If any of these things got a reaction out of you, then maybe they'd
make good examples for privacy/encryption scenarios.

Well, yes, but my point was really that we don't have one problem with
a single solution. What's a gaping hole in one system (physical
access) is a big HUH? in another.

Re. your point about security and burglary.  An intruder could copy a
one-time pad, but of course an intruder can also copy the private key to an
RSA system as well.  I'll admit that physical key control is easier with
public key systems: one just keeps one's key disc in one's personal
possession at all times, and keeps a couple of backup copies in the hands of
close trusted friends or family who understand and will take equal
precautions.  One could also design physical storage media which are
intrusion resistant in the sense of self-destructing if tampered with or fed
the wrong password; these would work as well for OTP keys as for RSA keys.

In some conceivable applications, physical security can be insured as a
matter of the vital interests of the participants.  

Again, I'm by no means trying to suggest that OTPs be considered for
particularly wide application.  Rather, that OTPs and a range of other
systems be designed, implemented, and made available so that potential users
can make their own informed choices.

Physical security is not a big issue for RSA (in the pgp implementation)
because the secret key ring is itself encrypted.  The problem is not so much
physical-intrusion-to-get-the-key as it is physical intrusion aimed at
modifying software.  It would be easy to modify pgp so that the keys are
logged, etc, in a way transparent to the user.  This is why it is important
to keep both the keys and the software that manipulates them off line.  It
is also important to keep the software from being tampered with.  The best
way to do this is to put the keys and the software on a hard disk, and put
the hard disk in a computer, and carry the computer with you whereever you
go.

RU 486 (no, it's not Intel's pharmaceuticals division).

This is actually a really good example of something that could be the
subject of the game.  Medical researchers need it because it has the
potential to save lives.  However, synthesis and import of it into the
United States is banned, no matter what quantities are needed or what use it
is needed for.  It is an interesting and powerful substance and we should be
doing research on it, but instead we are letting a small minority of people
with no medical knowledge dictate the policy of our entire nation.  Oh
well.  I hope to have European citizenship someday (especially if Geroge
wins).

To add my two cents, I once had some sensitive files solen from me.
the cracker had modified the crypt command to record passwords
and current directory (since crypt only works on stdin and stdout).

In a matter of a few days they have my crypt password and enough infomation
from my file to raise some real hell.  

Note that they did not bother with breaking the crypt or guessing the password
they just rigged the system binaries.

PS: this happend a year ago, and last  month a copy of the files
    appeared on some systems owned by the Bay Area Air Quality Management
    District in SF (baaqmd).

	was not avalible on the systems I was working on.

             Abortion Pill's Potential Use on Tumors
             Adds to Debate Over U.S. Market Entree
             ----
             By Ron Winslow
             Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
DD        10/12/92
SO        WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B8
LP           LOS ANGELES -- Medical researchers are studying a potential new
       *  use for the controversial French abortion pill RU-486: treatment
of
       *  benign brain tumors.
             A large-scale clinical trial was launched at the University of
       *  Southern California last week to determine whether the drug
          effectively slows or halts growth of meningiomas, tumors that
occur
       *  on the surface of the brain and spinal cord.
TX           The answer won't be known for several years, but the study adds
          another dimension to the debate over whether the drug, known as
          mifepristone, should be allowed on the market in the U.S.
          Rousell-Uclaf, its manufacturer, hasn't sought marketing approval
in
          the U.S. because of the heat of the political battle over
abortion.
          The study raises the possibility that a drug that could benefit
some
          patients won't become available because of a political dispute
over
          another application.
             ""There is a good chance there will be legitimate uses for this
          drug outside of contraception and abortion,"" said Steven Grunberg,
          an oncologist at the USC School of Medicine. ""Whether U.S.
          regulatory officials feel this will be sufficient for licensing
will
          be up to them.""
             A study published last week found the drug to be effective as a
          contraceptive when taken shortly after sexual intercourse. It is
          already used in France, the United Kingdom and Sweden to induce
          abortions within the first nine weeks of pregancy.
             Meningiomas account for 15% to 18% of all tumors in the central
          nervous system, and while they are benign -- meaning that they
don't
          spread to other parts of the body -- their growth can lead to such
          problems as seizures, blindness or paralysis. Most can be removed
by
       *  surgery, but some grow so close to crucial brain structures that
          surgery isn't possible.
             Dr. Grunberg told reporters at a science writers' conference
          sponsored by the American Medical Association that the large-scale
       *  trial of RU-486 for the tumors comes after a small pilot study of
28
          patients turned up encouraging, though not definitive results.
             In the small study, eight patients experienced improvement in
       *  symptoms or had minor reduction in tumor size, according to brain
          scans. In a few other patients, growth of the tumor stabilized
after
          treatment began. While not overwhelming evidence of effectiveness,
          the results were nevertheless sufficient to persuade the Food and
          Drug Administration to approve a large study that will involve 200
          patients at several U.S. medical centers, and will be based at
USC,
          Dr. Grunberg said.
             Results from the trial aren't expected for at least four years,
          and based on current medical practice, only a small number of
people
       *  would probably benefit from use of RU-486 in meningiomas. The
study
          might have broader impact by drawing attention to other potential
          benefits of a drug that isn't available in the U.S. because its
          primary application is to induce abortion.
             Dr. Grunberg said the drug is also being studied as a treatment
          for breast cancer, endometriosis and a disorder called Cushing's
          disease, which is characterized by obesity and hypertension.
Several
          other trials have been approved by the FDA, he added, though none
          has progressed as far as the meningioma study.
       *     He said his research team came upon RU-486 as a candidate for
          treating meningiomas because the drug blocks the action of
          progesterone, a hormone that appears to promote growth of the
          tumors. ""We didn't set out to make a political statement for
       *  RU-486,"" he said. ""It just appeared to fill the bill for what
we're
          trying to do.""

First, as a newcomer, and introduction. My name is Loyd Blankenship. I am
the Product Development Manager at Steve Jackson Games, and was the
employee raided by the Secret Service that set off the formation of the
EFF, our lawsuit against them, and much angst within the government. I also
use the nome de' plume ""The Mentor"" when traversing the computer underground.

On to stuff relevant to the list:

A group of us here in Austin have spent a great deal of time discussing
the advantages of RSA-encrypted e-mail. I'm putting a BBS back up later
in the year, and would like to offer secure communications to my users.
Since the threat of seizure is very real (the feds still have over $10,000
(1989 street price) of computer equipment of mine since I'm ""still under
investigation""), this needs to be implemented before the message is ever
written to hard disk.

To implement this, I'm currently trying to get PGP up on my Amiga, then
write the necessary C & AREXX functions to link it in with my BBS's (DLG
Pro) email function.

The outgrowth of this was the Keystone project. We're going to attempt to
get everyone in Austin cyberspace public-key capable, and get a master
keyring that will be regularly distributed via a trusted system to other
nodes in town. Ideally, you would be able to send RSA-encrypted email from
any bbs on any of the local nets to any other bbs -- even if all you know
is the destination address. We're going to do this by attempting to make
the bbs PGP-friendly. All the user has to do is generate a key pair.

The two potential weak links in this chain are line security and key
validation. The first is almost insurmountable -- unless the user takes the
time to d/l a complete copy of PGP and the Austin Keystone Keyring and
encrypt the mail on their home system. But if not, then they have to live
with the chance that someone is data-tapping. The second will rely on
face-to-face identification -- this is why we're making this a local effort.

It will probably be Christmas (when I have a 3-week vacation) before serious
strides are made in this, but I'm interested in any comments people may
have.

One time pad systems are expensive enough and in uncommon enough use
that I doubt they are going to get written as free software.  I
personally am not going to work on them, because I don't want to go
buy the necessary hardware to generate and hold sufficient key
material for a practical application.

You also need hardware random number generators for a secure OTP
system.  Such boxes are not readily available, or come cheap.  While
not obvious, making random bits is a very deep problem.  See Knuth
volume 2 for some insights.

I suspect that this same argument holds for all the rest of the people
in the group as well.  I don't know of anybody who wants to implement
this system for themselves, given the cost involved.

Cryptography is all economics, and the economics here are that one
time pad systems are expensive enough that the software that gets
written for them will be for in-house use or will be commercial.  In
either case, someone is paying someone else for developing the
software.

It might be possible that there are enough people who do want this
that there is some money for development.  A perfectly possible
outcome is the creation of a consortium to hire some implementers who
would make some gnu-ware.  Such organization does not exist.  Until it
does, an off-the-shelf OTP system won't exist.

Eric Hollander is correct.  Ideally, your keys and your encryption
mechanism should be kept secure.  At some point in the future, a small
card which contains all of this will be standard equipment, as well as
a port to plug it into.

First, let me congratulate Loyd and the others involved with Keystone
for working towards the creation of a local distribution mechanism for
keys.  

Every city in the U.S. needs something like this.  If it's not
happening in your area, start it.  Start by getting PGP and making your
own key.  Then exchange keys with people you know.

We have members of the list in many parts of the U.S., Canada, and
Europe.  There's plenty of work to do.  Look around.  If no one else
is doing this, you should.

There are, roughly speaking, two kinds of privacy; one is provided,
and one is defended.  Provided privacy is unstable, since the person
using the privacy does not create it.  Defended privacy is stable,
because those who want privacy create it themselves to the level at
which they want it.  Both systems do provide privacy, no mistake.

I would be hesitant to implement a system that _only_ required a user
to generate a key pair.  This, for the users, is too much provided
privacy.  It will not teach the users how privacy really works, nor
will it give them any good idea how their privacy is being maintained.

Defended privacy does not need to be difficult.  I would spend effort,
instead of modifying BBS software, to make it easier for users to
handle encrypted email with their own terminal programs.  

Now, any privacy is better than none.  I don't really know if it is
easier to modify your BBS or your modem program.  But all other things
being equal, make it easier for users to maintain their own privacy.

>[...] a master keyring that will be regularly distributed via a
>trusted system to other nodes in town.

Again, trusted systems can turn into provided privacy.  If there is a
distributed solution you can think up, use it.

This should not be such an onerous task.  It might be now, but that
can change.  Finding ways for users to manage keys, to get keys, and
to look up keys are all interesting and useful problems to solve.

Every user should encrypt outgoing mail on the home system before it
leaves and decrypt incoming mail on the home system after it arrives.
If this is not easy, it should be made easy.

Not every user need have the complete directory on their own system.
They merely need a way to communicate with those that they want to.
This probably means a directory service, where people can download
keys for the people they want to communicate with.  Moving around a
complete directory does not scale well.

As far as BBS support, if I want to respond to someone and I don't
have the corresponding key, I should be able to initiate a zmodem
transfer of that key relatively easily, for instance without leaving
the discussion area to go to a download area.

Funny thing is, when I first looked into crypto for dissident purposes, back
in 1981 or so, I was interested in a PKS implementation, but someone else in
my circle persuaded me that OTPs would be preferable in some cases.  Now
here we are with a PKS and I'm still making noises about OTPs.  

Guess the debate is closed for the moment... congratulations, y'all, for
good arguements in a good tone.

I can suggest a way to ""distribute"" a one time pad, even though the

This seems equivalent to the old ""dictionary"" or ""book"" cyphers that
people sometimes used. Good cryptanalysts broke them routinely. I'll
leave it to your imagination how one might do it, but I'll just note
that if you picked a few arbitrary bytes, say bytes 30-40, of all the
CDs in the record store, you would find that those few bytes likely
distinguish all but prehaps a token number of CDs.

Actually, in practice internal spies were almost never needed to break
book cyphers. They in fact provide only laughable security.
Traditional ones didn't even require that the cryptanalyst ever
determine what book was being used!

One of the things I've noticed about PGP is that it makes it pretty
obvious that you're sending an encrypted message.  The big

-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----

at the start pretty much gives that away.

In most cases, this is fine, but sometimes it may not be desirable
to make it this obvious.  Sending encrypted messages may call
unwelcome attention to yourself.  Also, some people are experimenting
with packet radio on the amateur bands, and it's not legal to send
encrypted messages there.

What I think would be nice would be an ""innocent"" mode for PGP
in which it created files which looked like something else.  For
example, what if your encrypted output file looked like:

begin 666 testpat.gif
MI\44:#G4D>QQXR!-M,Z20O1K&5D<U""C;V<J#-I@:ANT,A+>0, 5-4F.X<%MT
M2:V94,K;XE@B?]%IHF+_<VT=U! 3Q;;M-K<QT.N""?%IJTNU!%(KF7K]2^B6+
M;&TTGTULW(4%:F@\&MB^ ^Y5Y\#2A6^*86F-Y""^%J$>WGI%(]#=F]/[LV+&!
M,NH0(!3B35CW#!-Z7""B_L'=-C 8DLB-(J R""3?EE9<.>QE4Y?T$66IA7B@W?
end

This will be recognizable, if you've seen many, as a uuencoded file,
a common encoding for non-ascii files.  The header line suggests
that it is a graphics file.  Tons of these types of files are sent
across email networks every day.  Sending your encrypted messages
in this form would give you a lower profile.

Still, if someone goes to the effort to uudecode your message,
and examines the resulting file, it will be obvious that it's not
a GIF file because it lacks the proper headers.  Instead, with
the current PGP implementation it will be obvious that it is in
fact a PGP file, because the header format matches the PGP spec.

Again, I think it would be better if PGP in this mode were able to
produce a file without headers which will give away what it is.  Even
better would be the ability to mimic headers of some other types
of files, such as the .ZIP, .ZOO, or Unix ""compress"" format which are
often used in binary files people mail around.

Another thing that I think is kind of bad about PGP in the context
of avoiding traffic analysis is that it puts the key ID of the
destination person in the header.  There was some discussion during
development of a mode in which no key ID information would be in the
header; the only way you'd have of knowing if the message was for
you was to try decrypting it.  (There is a checksum which is used
internally to tell if the decryption was done with the right key.)
This way you could broadcast messages to some group, and no one could
know which person in the group you were sending to.

These ""anonymous destination"" messages could be encoded with a key
ID of zeros, and the PGP software could easily be modified to let
the user try a decryption on such a message, reporting success or
failure.

How useful do these kinds of features seem to people?  Would they
really be helpful or is this just paranoia?

Re use fo CD ROMs for OTPs.  That would seem to be a variation on the old
theme of the book cipher, which is *not* random and therefore *not* secure.
Also, agreeing on key procedures over the *phone* in *clear voice* is kind
of like sex without a condom.  Not secure.  Not safe.  Potentially deadly.

While we're on the subject of link encryption, the same response pertains to
the suggestion made by someone from SJG here (whose name I ought to know but
my memory for names has more holes than Bush's economic plan) about key
distribution and transmission of cleartext over phone lines.  It *doesn't
matter* if it's encrypted at the BBS server, if it goes in clear over the
phone.  Keyword in context recognition is no problem when dealing with
ASCII.  Various agencies (you know who) have raised this to a fine art.  The
telephone line is precisely the link in the chain which is weakest and needs
most to be protected.  If the nasty-wasties break down your door and go for
your hard drive, it's already too late.  Like worrying about a condom after
the fact.  

Now as a matter of record, 
it's been demonstrated that a processor emits electromagnetic radiation back
over the phone lines as well as electrical power lines, which can be picked
up at a distance.  So consider for a moment that there is a BBS serving
dissidents, who Big Brother wants to monitor.  Seeing all the encrypted
traffic, they install a device on the phone line and the AC to pick up what
the mircoprocessor is doing.  And they see it doing crypto, and they see the
cleartext which is recovered, and get the keys, and the whole damn thing may
as well be transparent.  So for BBSs and such, I would argue that it's
necessary to have electromechanical relays to isolate the computer from the
phone lines when encrypting or decrypting; ideally isolate it from the AC as
well (using an uninterruptable power supply, which will run the computer on
batteries for some period of time, say 45 minutes).  So you have a great big
red toggle switch next to the computer, and for some period during the day
when doing all the crypto processing, throw the switch to the Safe position
to get it off the phones and AC lines.  This might make BBS use a little
less convenient (in that email becomes available the day after it was
posted), but at least it's not literally leaking everyone's secrets into the
airwaves.  

This general area is part of a larger topic called TEMPEST.  Anyone else
interested in pursuing this angle...?

Hal, I think those would be vry useful.  Now of course, we don't want to
advocate that radio users in the United States do anything like sending
ciphertext over the airwaves, but we might want to develop something that we
can ship to the Gusanos who want to take Cuba back for the Mafia, or maybe
in a better vein, something that the Tien-an-men kids can use when
overthrowing the Commies in China.  

Good ideas about message headers.  Since the source code for PGP is widely
available, it would seem a straightforward matter to alter the program to
include the new features.  

What I'd really like also is a Mac version....

Re TEMPEST technology:

(Note that TEMPEST is the technology for _protection_ against electronic
eavesdropping on your computer emissions.  There is presumably a code
word for performing such snooping, but it must be secret.)

I've read that the worst emitter is your CRT screen.  In fact, they
say that you can sometimes put a TV-type monitor next to your computer
monitor and get a faint, ghosty image of your CRT screen on the second
monitor.  If you get this much without any amplification, it's under-
standable that high-quality equipment can pick up an image from a
greater distance.

The best way to avoid this, IMO, is to use a laptop.  The LCD display
of a laptop does not use the large electromagnetic fields that a CRT
display does.  Laptops also use lower power levels in general so they
should emit less.

I don't really know whether the ""raw"" CPU activity of your computer could
be picked up and interpreted at a distance.  With as many different
signals as there are on the address and data busses, along with all
the other wires you have, I can't really see how anything meaningful
could be picked up with remote monitoring.  It would seem that they'd
be totally jumbled.

So, for BBS use, where the system is operating automatically, I'd say
that it would be OK as long as you don't display any cleartext or
key/password information on the screen.  You could just turn the monitor
off when it's operating.  For home use, a laptop has the advantage that
it can have greater physical security (because it's smaller and more
portable), you can carry your decryption keys with you, you can download
to it at work or school and decrypt without trusting the multi-user
systems they have there, and it should be relatively immune to electro-
magnetic snooping.

First, let me get on record as saying that Hal's ""innocent mode"" is a
good idea that should be implemented.

But it's not really a good long-term solution from a social point of
view.  Encrypted traffic should become the norm, not the exception.
Flagging that you're sending encrypted traffic should be encouraged.
When questioned about this, people should respond in shocked tones
""What do mean?  Aren't you encrypting _your_ email?"" and then proceed
to suppress gentle laughter at them when they say no.

When it's cool to encrypt, only the uncool will be plain.

So, then, more peer pressure!  Consider someone asking you about your
encrypted mail to be an opportunity to start a conversation about
their position on personal privacy.  When your sysadmin asks why your
mail can't be read, tell him you are defending your privacy and ask if
there is any problem with that.  Then, when the sysadmin puts in a
filter for PGP traffic, use innocent mode.

>Another thing that I think is kind of bad about PGP in the context

Absolutely.  Ditto for signatures.  Both should be able to be
selectively removed.  In any case, it should be possible to have
nothing appear on the outer envelope.

Another feature for PGP would be automatic message padding.  To
properly do a mix you need to quantize the message lengths.  If PGP
were to automatically pad with random data, it would save a lot of
integration work for the mix.  PGP already has a random number
generator, after all.

About Tempest.

The ability to monitor is real; it's more powerful than you would first
imagine.

You can get a lot of insight into what is possible by looking at what
is sold as parts for Tempest certification.  There is some trade
publication devoted entirely to such matters; it's called EMI/RFI
News, or Interference Protection News, or something like that.  It's
free to qualified subscribers.  The articles are interesting, but
cannot delve into the really interesting stuff.  But the ads!  Look at
what people are selling, and remember that it is protecting against
something.  Stuff like copper impregnated gasket material, both for
computer cases and for doors (in walls).  Copper braid and cloth.
Conductive glues and caulks.  Special connectors.  Electrical
isolators.  Fiber optics.

(Aside: If you don't know how to be a qualified subscriber, you're no
hacker.  Look closely at the subscription card and then figure out
where the publisher of a free magazine gets its money.)

What is possible?  CRT monitoring.  A Dutch guy named van Eyck
demostrated six years ago or so a CRT monitoring system which he built
out of spare parts.  It consisted of an TV roof antenna, a non-detent
UHF tuner (which you can make yourself by removing the detent plate
from an old TV), and a multi-scanning monitor.  No amplification
beyond what was in the tuner, no sync stabilization, no special
directional antennas or any other tricks.  He was able to reliably
pick up monitor emissions from 100 meters, if I remember correctly.
Fancier equipment knows what your screen sync rate is, uses bandpass
filters, uses better antennas, knows to look for mostly-persistent
frame information, looks for emissions signatures, and is able to read
one CRT out of a hundred at half a mile.  I suspect this is a low
estimate of the ability of modern equipment.

Hal mentions using flat panel displays to combat emissions.  This
works, as evidenced by the continued existence of Grid Computer.
Remember Grid, who came out with these way-expensive gas plasma
laptops around 1985/6?  The reason they sold so many of those and are
still around was that a large number of them were Tempest certified.
(Even larger revenues!)  I understand that the Tempest spec Grids had
a thin layer of gold foil in front of the screen, even so.  Yes, gold
thin enough to see through.

Signal wire monitoring.  Using twisted pair or coax cable, reduces
transmitted energy down to very low levels, improving energy transfer
and reducing monitorability.  But even with zero radiated energy there
is still the near field of the wire which can be inductively tapped.
No conductive contact is necessary.  If you can put a wire next to my
phone line somewhere, you can tap my phone.  It's by nature a high
impedance tap, requring sensitive ampilifiers but at the same time
difficult to find even by a reflectometer.

Without a twisted pair, the situation is worse.  Keyboards for the PC
use a serial protocol at a fixed frequency.  The cables are not
twisted pair.  I haven't heard anything about that specifically, but I
presume that keystrokes can be read extremely easily.

CPU monitoring.  Yes, it's possible.  I've heard that it is possible
to actually run a CPU in parallel with a monitored one.  In order to
do this, you need to correlate signals in real time across a fairly
wide RF spectrum.  Each CPU pin or I/O bus signal occurs in a
different physical location inside the case.  The case is active in
terms of emmission, reflecting signals around like mad.  All these
different physical locations and reflections give rise to phase
differences and interference patterns.  Once you figure out what the
signatures of the various signals are, you can separate them out from
each other by correlation and deconvolution.  George's concern about
emissions through phone lines falls into this category.

Other stuff.  I've heard rumors about using microwave pinging to
determine stuff about electrical equipment.  Or about implanting
passive devices that alter the EM field locally in order to make
monitoring easier.  It's safe to presume that there is some amazing
stuff going on.  Read The Puzzle Palace for more hints.  (Like the
valley in WV which is one big antenna.)

Emissions monitoring is also all economics.  The price to monitor
increases with each more sophisticated attack.  CRT's are easy, CPU's
are hard.  I would like to see public research in this area, just like
there is public research in cryptography.  Until the public has a
better idea of what various attacks cost, there can't be rational
decisions about emissions security.

Like I said, just carry everything (keys and software) on your laptop.  As
soon as the Mac port of the pgp is finished, that's what I'll do.

:privacy.  It will not teach the users how privacy really works, nor
:will it give them any good idea how their privacy is being maintained.

I take the opposite view -- I dare *not* supply such a system. Any user that
is interested enough in 100% privacy will be encouraged -- both from the
email prompt and through the message bases/file areas -- to d/l a copy of
PGP. I'll probably write a tutorial on using it as well.

But many users do not have the interest/time/ability to set up PGP on their
home system. For them, I want to provide the best possible privacy given the
ease with which anyone who can find their local LMOS can tap (voice or data)
a line...

:Defended privacy does not need to be difficult.  I would spend effort,
:instead of modifying BBS software, to make it easier for users to

I don't have my user's terminal program -- I *do* have the bbs software.

:Again, trusted systems can turn into provided privacy.  If there is a
:distributed solution you can think up, use it.

I don't know any way to maintain an up-to-date, central keyring without
someone being in charge of regular updates. I'd make it available via
Fido, FTP, BMS and regular d/l.

                  Public Keys Depository Proposal
                        By Marcos R. Della
               (1:125/180 or marcos@zippy.sonoma.edu)


Def:  De.pos.i.to.ry (di-POZ-i-tohr-ee) n. a storehouse, a place for
safekeeping of things

-+---------------------------------------------------------------------+-

With the latest release of the PGP20 program, public key availability
has fallen into the hands of the individual.  This provides a relative
degree of security over messages that are sent from user to user in
various formats (text, binary, etc) over different transportation
mechanisms.  I will not go into the system that allows public keys to
work nor public key history.  Instead I'll point you to the rather
complete documentation that comes with the PGP program.

Unfortunately, there is a major drawback to this system (also pointed
out in the PGP documentation).  Public key distribution has few
security elements involved to insure the validity of a particular key.
PGP attempts to address this problem by providing a ""signature"" system
to each public key to give reasonable validity to its origin.
Unfortunately, this depends upon trust of the individual who signs the
key to begin with.  Who polices the policemen?

Unfortunatly, the issue of key validity is yet another topic that
cannot be easily addressed since authenticity lies in one persons
trust of another.  Yet there still needs to be a system in which keys
can be distributed or held for later use.  This system should be
multiply redundant and have some degree of immediate access in order
to make the information stored useful.  One such system would be a
depository, a place to store public keys for later retrieval.

This proposal will attempt to describe a system whereby you can get
around the validation of public keys problem without requiring someone
to police the Depository itself!

--------

Problems Involved:

 - How do you know the key depositor isn't faking his/her keys?

 - How do you verify (at the depository) that a key being deposited is
   from the key originator or is even valid?

 - What is to prevent the depository from faking keys that is ""signs""?

 - How can this system be resonably redundant and easy to access?

First off, the depository is NOT a validation center.  The system
never will verify the users as existing or if they are even honest
users.  The depository key signature only verifies that the key has
been deposited and is available for access at any time.  Again, the
depository DOES NOT verify users, only the fact that a deposit has
been made.  (A better form of deposit slip)

If a user wants to deposit his/her key, what is to prevent the sysop
from intercepting this public key, making a substitution replacement,
and then forwarding the new public key?  Unfortunately, there are
sysops out there that have already done this in some respects.
Thereby the system has to place the responsibility upon the user for
key deposit verification.  To prevent the sysop from changing the
deposit, the user should use the Depository Public Key (hereafter
referred to as DepoKey) to send his/her key for deposit.

Again, what prevents the ""bad"" sysop from just throwing this message
away (obviously he can't read it) and sending a fake message (also
encrypted with the DepoKey)?  Although this eventually thwarts the
entire system (the sysop cannot fake the users public key unless the
user uploads it in plain text to the sysop), it still causes problems.
To prevent this, the user should include some sort of text in the
deposit that the depository will mail back to the user, ENCRYPTED
along with the user's public key.  When the user receives a valid
message back that contains his original text, things are fine.  If the
user does not receive a response in a few days or gets an incorrect
return message, then the user should send a cancel message to the
depository and re-deposit his or her key.  The complete the handshake,
the user should send an authentication back to the depository stating
that the key was recieved correctly (instructions on how to do this
should be returned with the key). If a return reciept isn't back in a
resonable period of time, the depository will remove the key from its
deposit keyring.  NOTE:  This will never invalidate a public key, it
will only prevent it from being distributed via the depository system.

What is to prevent the depository from faking keys that it ""signs""?
Well, in order to be effective with fake keys, you need to be in the
transport path of the messages that you are planning on ""stealing"".
Since the depository is not a major hub or node (except possibly to a
few people) this negates any effect of faking keys.  Also, once a user
has received verification that the depository has his public key, he can
then also post it anywhere.  The depository will return his public key
with a depository signature on it.  This allows the user to upload a
verified key to anywhere.  When keys are distributed with a depository
signature on them, then they are on file with the depository in case
someone wants to withdraw them later.

As long as the public key for the depository is made worldwide public,
this system will work.

As for creating a multiply redundant system, there should be several
sites that are listed as depositories.  These systems will on a weekly
basis, exchange acknowledged keys (ie, keys that have undergone the
handshaking process) with one another.  A user can then request a key
from ANY of the depository sites and get the same information.
